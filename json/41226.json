However, much to her surprise, the once active senior has ended up becoming a \"lonesome\" student, preferring to spend his free time in quiet peace.\n\nUzaki does whatever she can to keep Sakurai from being \"alone,\" from convincing him to go to the movies to going to his part-time workplace. While Sakurai finds her irritating and tiresome, he still goes along with Uzaki's hijinks and shenanigans, even if he knows that her perky personality will only lead the two of them into various comical situations.\n\nEven so, as the days pass by, their relationship only gets better, to the point where people around them misinterpret them to be a couple. At any rate, whenever Uzaki wants to hang out with her upperclassman, fun and adorable wackiness is sure to follow!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"21:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 21:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/166\/Movic"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/238\/AT-X"},{"mal_id":392,"type":"anime","name":"Enterbrain","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/392\/Enterbrain"},{"mal_id":1345,"type":"anime","name":"Sammy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1345\/Sammy"},{"mal_id":1500,"type":"anime","name":"ABC Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1500\/ABC_Animation"},{"mal_id":1551,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Media House","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1551\/Kadokawa_Media_House"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1696\/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":1731,"type":"anime","name":"INCS toenter","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1731\/INCS_toenter"},{"mal_id":1903,"type":"anime","name":"IMAGICA Lab.","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1903\/IMAGICA_Lab"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1974,"type":"anime","name":"ENGI","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1974\/ENGI"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/50\/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":74,"type":"anime","name":"Romantic Subtext","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/74\/Romantic_Subtext"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":114417,"type":"manga","name":"Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/114417\/Uzaki-chan_wa_Asobitai"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":42962,"type":"anime","name":"Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai!
