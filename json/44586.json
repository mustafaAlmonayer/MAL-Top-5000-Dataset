Because of this raunchiness, when his daughter Hime was born, he vowed to keep his profession hidden from her, believing that she will be disillusioned if she finds out.\n\nThis paranoia-induced belief leads Kakushi into hectic situations. Despite being a single father, he does his best and often resorts to extreme ends just to protect his secret, such as guising as a salaryman every day or holding emergency drills in case Hime somehow finds her way to his workplace.\n\nKakushigoto tells the story of a father and daughter living side by side, maintaining their peaceful existence as the father attempts to preserve the status quo. However, there is a saying: \"there are no secrets that time cannot reveal.\" In time, Hime must learn the reality behind the things she took for granted as she grew up.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/719\/Studio_Mausu"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Ajia-do","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/30\/Ajia-do"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Childcare","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/53\/Childcare"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":94169,"type":"manga","name":"Kakushigoto","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/94169\/Kakushigoto"}]},{"relation":"Full story","entry":[{"mal_id":40716,"type":"anime","name":"Kakushigoto","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/40716\/Kakushigoto"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Chiisana Hibi (\u3061\u3044\u3055\u306a\u65e5\u3005)\" by flumpool","\"Kimi wa Tennenshoku (\u541b\u306f\u5929\u7136\u8272)\" by Eiichi Ootaki (\u5927\u6edd\u8a60\u4e00)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"https:\/\/kakushigoto-anime.com\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=15922"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=24236"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kakushigoto:_My_Dad%27s_Secret_Ambition#Film"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-282419"}]}}
