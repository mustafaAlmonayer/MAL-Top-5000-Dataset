Their strategic advantage, technological superiority, and military might make opposition nonexistent, so they steamroll through the border of the sleepy principality with ease.\n\nAs Imperial forces run through his quiet hometown, Welkin Gunther and his younger sister Isara jump into action, banding with the leader of the local militia to push the occupational forces out of the village. Quickly retreating to the Gallian capital, they are organized into a unit with the remnants of the militia, tasked with assisting in repelling the Imperial presence from the country.\n\nThough unfamiliar with war, the newly formed Squad Seven must defend their country from annexation. But as the battle rages on through the streets of Gallia, ancient secrets will bring the team closer than they'd ever anticipated.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2009,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/17\/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":167,"type":"anime","name":"Sega","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/167\/Sega"},{"mal_id":765,"type":"anime","name":"Sakura Create","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/765\/Sakura_Create"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":56,"type":"anime","name":"A-1 Pictures","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/56\/A-1_Pictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/38\/Military"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":11664,"type":"manga","name":"Senjou no Valkyria: Gallian Chronicles","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/11664\/Senjou_no_Valkyria__Gallian_Chronicles"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":7016,"type":"anime","name":"Senjou no Valkyria: SenVal Theater","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/7016\/Senjou_no_Valkyria__SenVal_Theater"}]},{"relation":"Alternative setting","entry":[{"mal_id":9793,"type":"anime","name":"Senjou no Valkyria 3: Tagatame no Juusou","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/9793\/Senjou_no_Valkyria_3__Tagatame_no_Juusou"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":37908,"type":"anime","name":"Senjou no Valkyria Special","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/37908\/Senjou_no_Valkyria_Special"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Asu e no Kizuna (\u660e\u65e5\u3078\u306e\u30ad\u30ba\u30ca)\" by HIMEKA (eps 1-13)","2: \"Kanashimi Rensa (\u30ab\u30ca\u30b7\u30df\u30ec\u30f3\u30b5)\" by MARIA (eps 14-26)"],"endings":["1: \"Ano Kaze ni Notte (\u30a2\u30ce\u98a8\u30cb\u30ce\u30c3\u30c6)\" by pe'zmoku (eps 1-13)","2: \"Hitotsu no Negai (\u3072\u3068\u3064\u306e\u9858\u3044)\" by Inoue Hikari (eps 14-25)","3: \"Brightest Morning\" by Hikari Inoue with 7th Squad (eps 26)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.valkyria-anime.com\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=6244"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=10416"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Valkyrie_of_the_Battlefield"}],"streaming":[]}}
