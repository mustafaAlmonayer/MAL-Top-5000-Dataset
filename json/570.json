During a botched interception of underground munitions being transferred by a terrorist organization, Constable Kazuki Fuse, a soldier in an elite counter-terrorism unit, witnesses the true terror of human nature. He fails to prevent a teenage girl from carrying out a desperate suicide bombing that subsequently causes immense destruction to Tokyo. With mental scars and his competence under question, Fuse is sent back to the military academy for re-evaluation. Unbeknownst to him, he will soon be caught up in a web of government conspiracies that have the power to determine the future of all of Japan.\n\nAs Fuse treads the fine line between human and beast, he ultimately discovers to which side he truly belongs.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"In 1999 Jin-Rou won second place for the Best Asian Film award at the Fant-Asia Film Festival in Canada.
