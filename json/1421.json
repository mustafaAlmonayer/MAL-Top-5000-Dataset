Lupin sneaks onto the island where, instead of treasure-hunting, he finds himself embroiled in a violent struggle for power. To Lupin's surprise, his old buddies Jigen and Goemon are also in the fight for their own reasons. Marcus the Merchant of Death also lands on the island accompanied by Fujiko, Lupin's greatest weakness, and followed by the police inspector, who is forever on Lupin's tail. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"VAP","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/29\/VAP"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/467\/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":65,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo Movie Shinsha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/65\/Tokyo_Movie_Shinsha"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/50\/Adult_Cast"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":1412,"type":"anime","name":"Lupin III","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1412\/Lupin_III"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Lupin III Theme (1989)\u201d by Yuji Ohno"],"endings":["\"He's gone\" by Michiko Kihara"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.tms-e.com\/library\/old\/tvsp\/data\/s_rupin_heming.html"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2014"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=2093"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Lupin_III_television_specials#ep2"}],"streaming":[]}}
