Usagi bids farewell to Mamoru, who is going to America to study abroad. In his place comes the Three Lights, an idol trio consisting of three boys, Seiya, Taiki, and Yaten. The new enemy is Galaxia, a woman who desires to rule the entire galaxy by collecting the Star Seeds of humans. Three new Senshi appear, the Sailor Starlights, who also intend to stop Galaxia without Sailor Moon's help.","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1996,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"TV Asahi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/55\/TV_Asahi"},{"mal_id":2292,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Advertising","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/2292\/Toei_Advertising"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/119\/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/66\/Mahou_Shoujo"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":92,"type":"manga","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/92\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1239,"type":"anime","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon SuperS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1239\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_SuperS"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":8756,"type":"anime","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Memorial","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/8756\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_Memorial"},{"mal_id":13931,"type":"anime","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Sailor Stars - Hero Club","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/13931\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon__Sailor_Stars_-_Hero_Club"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Sailor Star Song\" by Kae Hanazawa"],"endings":["1: \"Kaze mo Sora mo Kitto...\" by Arisa Mizuki (eps 1-33)","2: \"Moonlight Densetsu\" by Moon Lips (eps 34)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.toei-anim.co.jp\/lineup\/tv\/sailor_stars\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2542"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=795"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sailor_Moon_Sailor_Stars"}],"streaming":[]}}
