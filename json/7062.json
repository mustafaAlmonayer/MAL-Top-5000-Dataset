Now a seasoned vet of the Hidamari Apartments herself, Yuno's newest challenge is to help the latest arrivals, Nazuna and Nori, acclimate to life on their own. Of course, since it IS Hidamari, there are still lots of trials and tribulations ahead, and nothing will ever go quite as expected. But with friends like Miyako, Hiro, and Sae ready to lend a hand, there will always be a ray of sunshine at the end of every storm in Hidamari Sketch x Hoshimittsu.\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2010,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"01:29","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 01:29 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/17\/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/104\/Lantis"},{"mal_id":145,"type":"anime","name":"TBS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/145\/TBS"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/166\/Movic"},{"mal_id":797,"type":"anime","name":"Houbunsha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/797\/Houbunsha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/376\/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":44,"type":"anime","name":"Shaft","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/44\/Shaft"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"CGDCT","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/52\/CGDCT"},{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/63\/Iyashikei"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"},{"mal_id":80,"type":"anime","name":"Visual Arts","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/80\/Visual_Arts"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1362,"type":"manga","name":"Hidamari Sketch","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1362\/Hidamari_Sketch"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":6984,"type":"anime","name":"Hidamari Sketch x 365 Specials","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/6984\/Hidamari_Sketch_x_365_Specials"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":9563,"type":"anime","name":"Hidamari Sketch x \u2606\u2606\u2606 Specials","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/9563\/Hidamari_Sketch_x_\u2606\u2606\u2606_Specials"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":28915,"type":"anime","name":"Hidamari Sketch x \u2606\u2606\u2606 Recap","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/28915\/Hidamari_Sketch_x_\u2606\u2606\u2606_Recap"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Dekirukanatte\u2606\u2606\u2606 (\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u2606\u2606\u2606)\" by Yuno (Asumi Kana), Miyako (Mizukoshi Kaori), Hiro (Goto Yuko), Sae (Shintani Ryoko)"],"endings":["\"Sakura Sakura Saku ~Ano Hi Kimi wo matsu, Sora to Onajide~ (\u3055\u304f\u3089\u3055\u304f\u3089\u54b2\u304f \u301c\u3042\u306e\u65e5\u541b\u3092\u5f85\u3064 \u7a7a\u3068\u540c\u3058\u3067\u301c)\" by marble"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.tbs.co.jp\/anime\/hidamari\/3rd\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=7128"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=11047"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hidamari_Sketch"}],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https:\/\/www.hidive.com\/tv\/hidamari-sketch-hoshimittsu"}]}}
