Downtrodden and homeless, she runs into a man being harassed by a dog. After helping him, she explains her situation, and to her surprise, he offers her his home in gratitude. But when she discovers that said home is a rundown shrine, she tries to leave; however, she is caught by two shrine spirits and a fox familiar named Tomoe. They mistake her for the man Nanami rescued\u2014the land god of the shrine, Mikage. Realizing that Mikage must have sent her there as a replacement god, Tomoe leaves abruptly, refusing to serve a human.\n\nRather than going back to being homeless, Nanami immerses herself in her divine duties. But if she must keep things running smoothly, she will need the help of a certain hot-headed fox. In her fumbling attempt to seek out Tomoe, she lands in trouble and ends up sealing a contract with him. Now the two must traverse the path of godhood together as god and familiar; but it will not be easy, for new threats arise in the form of a youkai who wants to devour the girl, a snake that wants to marry her, and Nanami's own unexpected feelings for her new familiar.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2012,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"02:05","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 02:05 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/53\/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/64\/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/144\/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":148,"type":"anime","name":"Hakusensha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/148\/Hakusensha"},{"mal_id":315,"type":"anime","name":"DAX Production","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/315\/DAX_Production"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":73,"type":"anime","name":"TMS Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/73\/TMS_Entertainment"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/6\/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":8157,"type":"manga","name":"Kamisama Hajimemashita","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/8157\/Kamisama_Hajimemashita"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":18661,"type":"anime","name":"Kamisama Hajimemashita OVA","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/18661\/Kamisama_Hajimemashita_OVA"},{"mal_id":25681,"type":"anime","name":"Kamisama Hajimemashita\u25ce","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/25681\/Kamisama_Hajimemashita\u25ce"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Kamisama Hajimemashita (\u795e\u69d8\u306f\u3058\u3081\u307e\u3057\u305f)\" by Hanae"],"endings":["1: \"Kamisama Onegai (\u795e\u69d8\u304a\u9858\u3044)\" by Hanae (eps 1-9, 11-13)","2: \"Kamisama Onegai Datenshi\u2606Mix (\u300c\u795e\u69d8\u304a\u9858\u3044\u300d\u5815\u5929\u4f7f\u2606Mix)\" by KURAMA (Daisuke Kishio) featuring Hanae (eps 10)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.mikagesha.com\/1st\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=9298"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=14441"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kamisama_Kiss"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-264549"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/www.funimation.com\/shows\/kamisama-kiss"}]}}
