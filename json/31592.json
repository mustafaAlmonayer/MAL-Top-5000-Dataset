After Satoshi obtains his seventh gym badge, the group is moving toward the next town when Eureka discovers a mysterious Pok\u00e9mon resting in her pochette. Soon given the name Puni-chan, it is one that even Satoshi and Serena's new Pok\u00e9mon Zukan cannot identify. However, it quickly becomes apparent that Puni-chan is the target of a mysterious group clad in bright red suits known as Team Flare, aiming to capture the new Pok\u00e9mon to further their agenda. But when Satoshi and the gang realize that the enigmatic organization has no intention of treating Puni-chan with any decency, they take a stand in opposition to Team Flare's plans, daring to fight back.\n\nWith Gojika's predictions looming above them, Satoshi aims for his final gym badge while Serena contests for her last Princess Key in order to be able to compete at the TriPokalon Master Class. But as Team Flare begins to move in search of the mysterious Z, the stories of Pokemon XY and Pokemon XY: Mega Evolution cross paths as Satoshi and his friends, along with Team Rocket, get caught up in a scheme that could put Kalos in great danger.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2015,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"18:55","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 18:55 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":499,"type":"anime","name":"The Pokemon Company International","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/499\/The_Pokemon_Company_International"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/28\/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":19291,"type":"anime","name":"Pokemon XY","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/19291\/Pokemon_XY"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":23301,"type":"anime","name":"Pokemon XY: Mega Evolution","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/23301\/Pokemon_XY__Mega_Evolution"},{"mal_id":31231,"type":"anime","name":"Pokemon Movie 19: Volcanion to Karakuri no Magearna","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/31231\/Pokemon_Movie_19__Volcanion_to_Karakuri_no_Magearna"},{"mal_id":34325,"type":"anime","name":"Pokemon XY&Z Specials","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/34325\/Pokemon_XY_Z_Specials"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":32359,"type":"anime","name":"Pokemon XY&Z: Subete no Nazo wo Tokiakase!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/32359\/Pokemon_XY_Z__Subete_no_Nazo_wo_Tokiakase"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":34034,"type":"anime","name":"Pokemon Sun & Moon","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/34034\/Pokemon_Sun___Moon"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"XY&Z\" by Satoshi (CV: Rica Matsumoto)"],"endings":["1: \"Puni-chan no Uta (\u30d7\u30cb\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306e\u3046\u305f)\" by Eureka (Mariya Ise) (eps 1-13, 15-19, 21-30, 32-34, 38-41, 44, 45)","2: \"Rocket-dan Danka (\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u56e3\u56e3\u6b4c)\" by Rocket-dan (eps 14)","3: \"DoriDori (\u30c9\u30ea\u30c9\u30ea)\" by Serena (Mayuki Makiguchi) (eps 20)","4: \"Kira Kira (\u30ad\u30e9\u30ad\u30e9)\" by Citron (Yuki Kaji) (eps 31)","5: \"Pikachuu no Uta (\u30d4\u30ab\u30c1\u30e5\u30a6\u306e\u3046\u305f)\" by Pikachuu (Ikue Ootani) (eps 35-37)","6: \"Nyarth no Ballad (\u30cb\u30e3\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30d0\u30e9\u30fc\u30c9)\" by Nyarth (Inuko Inuyama) (eps 42, 43, 46)","7: \"V (Volt) (\uff36\uff08\u30dc\u30eb\u30c8\uff09)\" by Yusuke (eps 47)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.tv-tokyo.co.jp\/anime\/pokemon_xyz\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=11585"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=17650"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pok%C3%A9mon_(anime)"}],"streaming":[]}}
