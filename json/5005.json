Sunred, ally of justice, is dedicated to stopping the evil organization Florsheim on their quest for world domination, while General Vamp and his minions are constantly thinking up new schemes to defeat Sunred. In what sounds like a typical story, the characters make all the difference. \n\nOur hero Sunred is rude, violent, and lazy, playing pachinko all day and leeching off of his girlfriend Kayoko Uchida. Meanwhile General Vamp is polite, conscientious, and an ideal homemaker who cooks, mothers his minions, and discusses housekeeping with Kayoko, who bickers constantly with Sunred. Even the monsters of Florsheim tend to be adorable and harmless.\n\nEach episode is comprised of several shorts weighing in at anywhere from a few minutes to a few seconds, and explores the daily lives of these sworn enemies. This is the story of the battle between good and evil that takes place in Kawasaki.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":464,"type":"anime","name":"flying DOG","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/464\/flying_DOG"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":88,"type":"anime","name":"AIC ASTA","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/88\/AIC_ASTA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":57,"type":"anime","name":"Gag Humor","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/57\/Gag_Humor"},{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/20\/Parody"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/31\/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":12552,"type":"manga","name":"Tentai Senshi Sunred","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/12552\/Tentai_Senshi_Sunred"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":6582,"type":"anime","name":"Tentai Senshi Sunred 2nd Season","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/6582\/Tentai_Senshi_Sunred_2nd_Season"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":8314,"type":"anime","name":"Tentai Senshi Sunred: Short Corner","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/8314\/Tentai_Senshi_Sunred__Short_Corner"}]},{"relation":"Character","entry":[{"mal_id":8316,"type":"anime","name":"Kawasaki Frontale x Tentai Senshi Sunred","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/8316\/Kawasaki_Frontale_x_Tentai_Senshi_Sunred"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Mizunokuchi Taiyou Zoku\" by manzo (eps 1-12, 14-26)","2: \"Family Restaurant Taiy\u014d Zoku\" (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ec\u30b9\u592a\u967d\u65cf)\" by manzo (Composition) (eps 13)"],"endings":["1: \"Niwatori Dango Nabe\" by Kumahachi Morino (eps 1-9, 11-15, 17-26)","2: \"Shuchishin\" Ringtone Version (\u300e\u7f9e\u6065\u5fc3\u300f\u7740\u30e1\u30ed\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3)\" by Kei Takahara (Composition) (eps 10)","3: \"Theme of Tentai Senshi Sun Red\" (\u5929\u4f53\u6226\u58eb\u30b5\u30f3\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30de)\" by Tomomi Kasai & Tomomi Itano (eps 16)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.sunred.jp\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=6049"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=10193"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tentai_Senshi_Sunred"}],"streaming":[]}}
