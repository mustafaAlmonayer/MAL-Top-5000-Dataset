Accompanied by a great flash of light, they hear a mysterious woman's plea to save \"Cephiro,\" and the junior high heroines are suddenly swept away by a giant flying fish. Afterwards, they arrive in an unknown land, where they encounter a man called Master Mage Clef.\n\nClef informs the girls that they were summoned by Princess Emeraude to fulfill their destinies as Magic Knights, restoring peace and balance in Cephiro. The formerly lively and peaceful land has been in disarray ever since High Priest Zagato imprisoned the princess, who acted as Cephiro's pillar of stability. The Magic Knights reluctantly accept Clef's words as truth and embark on a journey to save Cephiro from the clutches of evil.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Although the first season is a near-direct adaptation of the first arc of the manga, there are several small additions, including the anime original character Inouva. Magic Knight Rayearth's opening theme song, Yuzurenai Negai, was awarded the \"Best Theme Song\" at the first ever Animation Kobe Awards in 1996.","season":"fall","year":1994,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"19:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 19:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":76,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri Telecasting","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/76\/Yomiuri_Telecasting"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/250\/Media_Blasters"},{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/467\/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":65,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo Movie Shinsha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/65\/Tokyo_Movie_Shinsha"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Isekai","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/62\/Isekai"},{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/66\/Mahou_Shoujo"},{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"manga","name":"Magic Knight Rayearth","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/119\/Magic_Knight_Rayearth"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1563,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Knight Rayearth II","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1563\/Magic_Knight_Rayearth_II"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":1954,"type":"anime","name":"Rayearth","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1954\/Rayearth"},{"mal_id":38372,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Knight Rayearth Pilot","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/38372\/Magic_Knight_Rayearth_Pilot"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Yuzurenai Negai\" by Naomi Tamura"],"endings":["\"Asue no Yuuki\" by Keiko Yoshinari"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.tms-e.com\/library\/old\/tv\/data\/t_reyearth.html"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=127"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=38"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Magic_Knight_Rayearth"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-283132"}]}}
