One way of dealing with them is through brute force and killing them... or making them fall in love and sealing their powers. \n\nHaving sealed three Spirits, Shidou Itsuka continues his mission with Ratatoskr in locating more spirits and dating them, to ensure the world's safety from further destruction. However, this time around, their problems will not be limited to Spirits as a more imposing threat seems to have noticed their activities.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Date A Live II adapts novels 5-7 of Koushi Tachibana's light novel series of the same name. Like with the first season, the Japanese home video releases have a Director's Cut with many new scenes. However, the English dub by FUNimation Entertainment does not feature these new scenes as they didn't have them in their home video releases.","season":"spring","year":2014,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:35","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:35 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/113\/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/238\/AT-X"},{"mal_id":323,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Columbia","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/323\/Nippon_Columbia"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1053,"type":"anime","name":"Production IMS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1053\/Production_IMS"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/35\/Harem"},{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":37523,"type":"manga","name":"Date A Live","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/37523\/Date_A_Live"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":17641,"type":"anime","name":"Date A Live: Date to Date","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/17641\/Date_A_Live__Date_to_Date"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":22961,"type":"anime","name":"Date A Live II: Kurumi Star Festival","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/22961\/Date_A_Live_II__Kurumi_Star_Festival"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":24655,"type":"anime","name":"Date A Live Movie: Mayuri Judgment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/24655\/Date_A_Live_Movie__Mayuri_Judgment"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Trust in you\" by sweet ARMS"],"endings":["1: \"Day to Story\" by Kaori Sadohara (eps 1-9)","2: \"My Treasure\" by Miku Izayoi (CV: Minori Chihara) (eps 10)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/date-a-live-anime.com\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=9935"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=15790"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Date_A_Live"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-275937"}]}}
