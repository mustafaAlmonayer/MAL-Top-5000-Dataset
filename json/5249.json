To protect mankind from his terrible power, Sharaku is made to wear a bandage which seals his third eye. While his eye is sealed, Sharaku knows nothing of his true nature or his power, and does not remember his evil half's sinister attempts to conquer the world.","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1990,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":200,"type":"anime","name":"Tezuka Productions","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/200\/Tezuka_Productions"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":10798,"type":"manga","name":"Mitsume ga Tooru","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/10798\/Mitsume_ga_Tooru"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":19773,"type":"anime","name":"Akuma Tou no Prince: Mitsume ga Tooru","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/19773\/Akuma_Tou_no_Prince__Mitsume_ga_Tooru"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"?
