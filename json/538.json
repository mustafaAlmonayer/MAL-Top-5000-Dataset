This confession comes as a shock not only to Tenchi, but also the girls back home. In response, the girls decide to step up their game, and they immediately flock to Tokyo to take Tenchi for themselves. \n\nWith the girls competing for his love, Tenchi must decide once and for all who the most important woman in his life is.
