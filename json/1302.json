Having returned from his journey aboard the train Galaxy Express 999, Tetsurou Hoshino joins the resistance and fights alongside others who have retained their humanity.\n\nWhen the 999 returns to Earth, Tetsurou receives an enigmatic recorded message from his former traveling companion Maetel, telling him to board the train once more. Fighting his way to Megalopolis station, he makes it onto the train just as it departs. This time, however, Tetsurou is met with several mysteries: Maetel is nowhere to be seen, an ominous \"Ghost Train\" has appeared, and the ultimate destination of the 999 is unknown. Amid all this, Tetsurou finds himself confronted by the mysterious black knight Faust and soon discovers the machine empire's darkest secret.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The movie won the 1981 Animage's Anime Grand Prix Award.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/467\/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/29\/Space"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1301,"type":"anime","name":"Ginga Tetsudou 999 (Movie)","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1301\/Ginga_Tetsudou_999_Movie"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":3602,"type":"anime","name":"Ginga Tetsudou 999: Eternal Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3602\/Ginga_Tetsudou_999__Eternal_Fantasy"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Sayonara\" by Mary MacGregor"],"endings":["\"Sayonara\" by Mary MacGregor"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.toei-anim.co.jp\/movie\/999\/index.html"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=765"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=508"}],"streaming":[]}}
