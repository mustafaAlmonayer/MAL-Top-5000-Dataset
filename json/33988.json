Along the way, Takahashi also meets fellow teacher Sakie Satou, a succubus with an aversion towards men. To fulfill his goal of learning more about the Demi, Takahashi decides to conduct casual interviews with the girls to learn more about their abilities, psyche, and interaction with human society. As Takahashi strengthens his bond with his students, he soon discovers that the Demi are not as unusual as he initially believed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/17\/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/159\/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1677,"type":"anime","name":"Kanetsu Investment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1677\/Kanetsu_Investment"},{"mal_id":2223,"type":"anime","name":"Christmas Holly","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/2223\/Christmas_Holly"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"},{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1468\/Crunchyroll"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":56,"type":"anime","name":"A-1 Pictures","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/56\/A-1_Pictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/6\/Mythology"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"},{"mal_id":32,"type":"anime","name":"Vampire","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/32\/Vampire"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":82745,"type":"manga","name":"Demi-chan wa Kataritai","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/82745\/Demi-chan_wa_Kataritai"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":35823,"type":"anime","name":"Demi-chan wa Kataritai: Demi-chan no Natsuyasumi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/35823\/Demi-chan_wa_Kataritai__Demi-chan_no_Natsuyasumi"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Original.
