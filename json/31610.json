When she refuses to do so, a bitter quarrel breaks out between them. Meanwhile, the scheming Damashigami Company shows no sign of halting its wrongdoings, and the bat-like demon Masato continues to commit devious acts to pursue his long-awaited revenge on Rinne.\n\nFor Sakura and Rinne, these paranormal complications never seem to end. As their saga continues to unfold, they must cope with these unusual circumstances as they appear, all while facing problems of their own.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2016,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"17:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 17:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/62\/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":111,"type":"anime","name":"NHK","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/111\/NHK"},{"mal_id":1430,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1430\/Shogakukan"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/376\/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Brain's Base","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/112\/Brains_Base"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":13558,"type":"manga","name":"Kyoukai no Rinne","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/13558\/Kyoukai_no_Rinne"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":28423,"type":"anime","name":"Kyoukai no Rinne","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/28423\/Kyoukai_no_Rinne"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":34106,"type":"anime","name":"Kyoukai no Rinne 3rd Season","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/34106\/Kyoukai_no_Rinne_3rd_Season"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Melody\" by Pile (eps 1-12)","2: \"Ainii (\u30a2\u30a4\u30cb\u30fc)\" by CreepHyp (\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30d7\u30cf\u30a4\u30d7) (eps 13-25)"],"endings":["1: \"Hanashi wo Shiyou (\u8a71\u3092\u3057\u3088\u3046)\" by GLIM SPANKY (eps 1-12)","2: \"Beautiful Life\" by Shiggy Jr.  (eps 13-25)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/anime-rinne.com\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=11591"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=17656"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rin-ne"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-265781"},{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https:\/\/www.hidive.com\/tv\/rin-ne-2"}]}}
