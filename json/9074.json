Now known as \"Recruit,\" Kou Ichinomiya has adjusted to the troubles his unconventional neighbors brew daily.

In spite of all the commotion, Recruit gradually learns more about his lover Nino and the story that shaped her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Arakawa Under the Bridge x Bridge was released on Blu-ray and DVD by NIS America on February 7, 2012 and on April 29, 2014 for the premium and standard editions respectively.","season":"fall","year":2010,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"01:35","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 01:35 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/58\/Square_Enix"},{"mal_id":92,"type":"anime","name":"Starchild Records","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/92\/Starchild_Records"},{"mal_id":717,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo Music","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/717\/TV_Tokyo_Music"},{"mal_id":721,"type":"anime","name":"GANSIS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/721\/GANSIS"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":372,"type":"anime","name":"NIS America, Inc.","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/372\/NIS_America_Inc"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":44,"type":"anime","name":"Shaft","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/44\/Shaft"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":14154,"type":"manga","name":"Arakawa Under the Bridge","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/14154\/Arakawa_Under_the_Bridge"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":7647,"type":"anime","name":"Arakawa Under the Bridge","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/7647\/Arakawa_Under_the_Bridge"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"COSMOS vs ALIEN\" by Etsuko Yakushimaru","2: \"Kou-sama\u2606Go!
