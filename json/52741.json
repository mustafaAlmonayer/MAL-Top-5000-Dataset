For the past 10 years, Fuuko has been afflicted by a condition that brings extreme misfortune to anyone who touches her. This has had a drastic effect on her surroundings, even inadvertently resulting in the deaths of those around her\u2014including her parents.\n\nAs she stands on a bridge above train tracks, Fuuko is touched by a strange man, causing the footing underneath him to break and dropping him in front of an oncoming train. However, when Fuuko finds the man's corpse, she discovers that his body is regenerating and that he is coming back to life.\n\nThe man, whom Fuuko names Andy, is immortal\u2014and like her, he also wishes for death. Initially dismissive, Fuuko eventually decides to team up with Andy to give him the best death possible; but a mysterious organization lurks in the shadows, hoping to take advantage of the duo's bizarre abilities.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:23","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:23 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":73,"type":"anime","name":"TMS Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/73\/TMS_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/143\/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":306,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Capsule","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/306\/Magic_Capsule"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1365\/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":287,"type":"anime","name":"David Production","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/287\/David_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/31\/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":123956,"type":"manga","name":"Undead Unluck","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/123956\/Undead_Unluck"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"01\" by Ziyoou-vachi"],"endings":["1: \"01\" by Ziyoou-vachi (ep 1)","2: \"know me...\" by Kairi Yagi (eps 2-)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"https:\/\/undead-unluck.net\/"},{"name":"@undeadunluck_an","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/undeadunluck_an"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=17586"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=26250"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Undead_Unluck#Anime"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%B3%E3%83%87%E3%83%83%E3%83%89%E3%82%A2%E3%83%B3%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF"},{"name":"Syoboi","url":"https:\/\/cal.syoboi.jp\/tid\/6820"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Disney+","url":"https:\/\/www.disneyplus.com\/"},{"name":"Bahamut Anime Crazy","url":"https:\/\/ani.gamer.com.tw\/"},{"name":"Hulu","url":"https:\/\/www.hulu.com\/"}]}}
