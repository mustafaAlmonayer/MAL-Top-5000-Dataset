This whimsical place, oddly lacking in food and running water but full of electrical sockets, is home to a petulant girl in a mask, named Wolf Queen and becomes their playground and refuge during school hours. Hidden within the walls, they're told there's a key that will grant one wish, as well as a set of clues to find it. But there's a catch: the key must be found by the end of the school year and they must leave the premises by five o'clock each day or else suffer a fatal end.\n\nAs time passes, a devastating truth emerges: only those brave enough to share their stories will be saved. And so they begin to unlock each other's stories: how a boy is showered with more gadgets than love; how another suffers a painful and unexplained rejection, and how a girl lives in fear of her predatory stepfather. As they struggle to abide by the rules of the game, a moving story unfolds, of seven characters trapped in a cycle of misunderstanding and loneliness, who are ultimately set free by the power of friendship, empathy, and sacrifice. \n\n(Source: Erewhon Books, edited)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":109,"type":"anime","name":"Shochiku","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/109\/Shochiku"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":783,"type":"anime","name":"GKIDS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/783\/GKIDS"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":56,"type":"anime","name":"A-1 Pictures","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/56\/A-1_Pictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":144393,"type":"manga","name":"Kagami no Kojou","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/144393\/Kagami_no_Kojou"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Merry-Go-Round (\u30e1\u30ea\u30fc\u30b4\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9)\" by Yuuri"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"https:\/\/movies.shochiku.co.jp\/kagaminokojo\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=17219"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=25375"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lonely_Castle_in_the_Mirror#Anime_film"}],"streaming":[]}}
