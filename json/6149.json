She is often called \"Chibi Maruko-chan\" due to her young age and small size. She lives together with her parents, her grandparents and her elder sister in a little town. In school, she has many friends with whom she studies and plays together everyday, including her close pal, Tama-chan; the student committee members, Maruo-kun and Migiwa-san; and the B-class trio: 'little master' Hanawa-kun, Hamaji-Bu Taro and Sekiguchi-kun. This is a fun-loving and enjoyable anime that portrays the simple things in life.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"winter","year":1995,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Ajia-do","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/30\/Ajia-do"},{"mal_id":611,"type":"anime","name":"Sakura Production","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/611\/Sakura_Production"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/22\/Nippon_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":15530,"type":"manga","name":"Chibi Maruko-chan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/15530\/Chibi_Maruko-chan"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":951,"type":"anime","name":"Chibi Maruko-chan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/951\/Chibi_Maruko-chan"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":30803,"type":"anime","name":"Planetarium Chibi Maruko-chan, Hoshi ni Negai wo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/30803\/Planetarium_Chibi_Maruko-chan_Hoshi_ni_Negai_wo"},{"mal_id":50465,"type":"anime","name":"Odoru Pompokolin","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/50465\/Odoru_Pompokolin"},{"mal_id":53951,"type":"anime","name":"Planetarium Chibi Maruko-chan: Soredemo Chikyuu wa Mawatteiru","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/53951\/Planetarium_Chibi_Maruko-chan__Soredemo_Chikyuu_wa_Mawatteiru"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":31202,"type":"anime","name":"Chibi Maruko-chan Movie: Italia kara Kita Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/31202\/Chibi_Maruko-chan_Movie__Italia_kara_Kita_Shounen"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Ureshii Yokan\" by Marina Watanabe (eps 1-73)","2: \"Humming ga Kikoeru\" by Kahimi Karie (eps 74-179)","3: \"Odoru Ponpokorin\" by ManaKana & Shigeru Izumiya (eps 180-253)","4: \"KinKi no Yaru Ki Man Man Song\" by KinKi Kids (eps 254-294)","5: \"Odoru Ponpokorin\" by B.B.Queens (eps 295-746,793-806,872-953)","6: \"Odoru Ponpokorin (2010 Version)\" by Bose & Ani (SCHADARAPARR) (eps 747-792)","7: \"Odoru Ponpokorin (25th Anniversary Version)\" by B.B.Queens (eps 807-871)","8: \"Odoru Ponpokorin (2014 Version)\" by E-girls (eps 954-1046)","9: \"Odoru Ponpokorin (2016 Version)\" by Golden Bomber (eps 1047-1190)","10: \"Odoru Ponpokorin (2019 Version)\" by Momoiro Clover Z (eps (ep 1191-?))"],"endings":["1: \"Hari-kiri Jiisan no Rock 'n' Roll\" by Hitoshi Ueki (eps 1-27,29-73)","2: \"Hari-kiri Jiisan no Rock 'n' Roll\" by Grandfather Grandfather (Takeshi Aono) and the children (eps 28)","3: \"Akke ni Torareta Toki no Uta\" by tama (eps 74-130,132-179)","4: \"Jaga Buttercorn-san\" by ManaKana (eps 180-230)","5: \"Chibi Maruko Ondo\" by ManaKana (eps 231-340)","6: \"Kyuujitsu no Uta (Viva La Viva)\" by Delighted Mint (eps 341-416)","7: \"Uchuu Dai Shuffle\" by Love Jets (eps 417-481)","8: \"Arara no Jumon\" by Chibi Maruko-chan with Bakuchu Mondai (eps 482-850)","9: \"Hyaku-man Nen no Shiawase!!\" by Kuwata Keisuke (eps (eps 851- ???))","10: \"Kimi wo Wasurenai yo\" by Sakurako Ohhara (eps (eps ???-))"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.nippon-animation.co.jp\/na\/maruko\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1842"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=909"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chibi_Maruko-chan"}],"streaming":[]}}
