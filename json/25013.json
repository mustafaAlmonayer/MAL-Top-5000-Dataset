Named Yona, she has grown up sheltered in the royal palace, shielded from any danger that may befall her. However, all good things must come to an end.\n\nYona's perfect world comes crashing down when a heinous act of treason threatens to erase all that she holds dear, including her birthright as the princess of Kouka. Left with no one to trust but her childhood friend and loyal bodyguard Son Hak, she is forced to flee the palace. Faced with the perils of surviving in the wild with a target on her back, Yona realizes that her kingdom is no longer the safe haven it once was.\n\nFree from the shackles of naivety, Yona vows to do everything in her power to become strong enough to crush her enemies. With Hak by her side, she must piece together the remains of an ancient legend that might be the key to reclaiming her kingdom from those who conspired to steal it from her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The voice cast of the anime adaptation includes voice actors from the drama CD adaptation of the manga, allowing them to reprise their old roles alongside new cast members.","season":"fall","year":2014,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"23:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 23:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"VAP","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/29\/VAP"},{"mal_id":148,"type":"anime","name":"Hakusensha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/148\/Hakusensha"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/238\/AT-X"},{"mal_id":711,"type":"anime","name":"Delfi Sound","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/711\/Delfi_Sound"},{"mal_id":751,"type":"anime","name":"Marvelous AQL","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/751\/Marvelous_AQL"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1211\/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1225,"type":"anime","name":"Age Global Networks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1225\/Age_Global_Networks"},{"mal_id":1334,"type":"anime","name":"Docomo Anime Store","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1334\/Docomo_Anime_Store"},{"mal_id":1637,"type":"anime","name":"Top-Insight International","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1637\/Top-Insight_International"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1\/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":21525,"type":"manga","name":"Akatsuki no Yona","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/21525\/Akatsuki_no_Yona"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":30370,"type":"anime","name":"Akatsuki no Yona OVA","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/30370\/Akatsuki_no_Yona_OVA"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Akatsuki no Yona (\u6681\u306e\u30e8\u30ca)\" by Kunihiko Ryo (eps 1-14)","2: \"Akatsuki no Hana (\u6681\u306e\u83ef)\" by Cyntia (eps 15-23)"],"endings":["1: \"Yoru (\u591c)\" by vistlip (eps 1-14)","2: \"Akatsuki (\u6681)\" by Akiko Shikata (eps 15-24)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.marv.jp\/special\/yona\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=10725"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=16154"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Akatsuki_no_Yona:_Yona_of_the_Dawn"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-263257"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/www.funimation.com\/shows\/yona-of-the-dawn"}]}}
