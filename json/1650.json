The inhabitants have been forced underground to escape the irradiated surface, but the deadly radiation inches closer and closer to the retreating population. With only one year before complete and utter extermination, time is fast running out and hope is in short supply.\n\nSo far, any attempt to escape or retaliate has been instantly annihilated by the alien empire\u2014until an emergency transmission from the planet Iscandar in a neighboring galaxy offers a glimmer of hope to save the doomed planet. Covertly, Earth's Self Defense Force constructs a faster than light engine for a journey to Iscandar. Armed with new weapons and a determined crew of fearless navy men, the World War II era battleship Yamato is reborn as Space Battleship Yamato. She and her crew set out on a perilous journey across the stars to save their home and the entire human race.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Winner of the 1975 Seiun Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.","season":"fall","year":1974,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"19:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 19:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":577,"type":"anime","name":"Tohokushinsha Film Corporation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/577\/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"},{"mal_id":589,"type":"anime","name":"Academy Productions","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/589\/Academy_Productions"},{"mal_id":675,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri Advertising","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/675\/Yomiuri_Advertising"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1571,"type":"anime","name":"Voyager Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1571\/Voyager_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":86,"type":"anime","name":"Group TAC","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/86\/Group_TAC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/46\/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/50\/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/38\/Military"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/29\/Space"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":31937,"type":"manga","name":"Shin Uchuu Senkan Yamato","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/31937\/Shin_Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato"},{"mal_id":33333,"type":"manga","name":"Uchuu Senkan Yamato","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/33333\/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":711,"type":"anime","name":"Uchuu Senkan Yamato (Movie)","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/711\/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato_Movie"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1651,"type":"anime","name":"Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1651\/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato_2"}]},{"relation":"Spin-off","entry":[{"mal_id":6718,"type":"anime","name":"Yamato 2520","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/6718\/Yamato_2520"},{"mal_id":7122,"type":"anime","name":"Dai Yamato Zero-gou","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/7122\/Dai_Yamato_Zero-gou"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":12029,"type":"anime","name":"Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/12029\/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato_2199"},{"mal_id":37082,"type":"anime","name":"Uchuu Senkan Yamato Pilot Film","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/37082\/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato_Pilot_Film"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Uchuu Senkan Yamato (\u5b87\u5b99\u6226\u8266\u30e4\u30de\u30c8)\" by Isao Sasaki (eps 1-21,23-25)"],"endings":["1: \"Makka na Scarf\" by Isao Sasaki (eps 1-21,23-25)","2: \"Uchuu Senkan Yamato (\u5b87\u5b99\u6226\u8266\u30e4\u30de\u30c8)\" by Isao Sasaki (eps 22)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.bandaivisual.co.jp\/yamato\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=648"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=338"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Space_Battleship_Yamato"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/www.funimation.com\/shows\/star-blazers"}]}}
