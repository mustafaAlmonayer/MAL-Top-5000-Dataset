The character designer was different from the one who handled the TV series, resulting in the characters' modeling more closely to the manga's creator Rumiko Takahashi's art style. In Japan, there were two DVD releases: one on August 21, 2002 and another on November 26, 2004. The first included a bonus CD with an original audio drama titled Inuyasha - Toki wo Koeru Mou Hitotsu no Omoi, while the second was a standard edition single disc. The English version was made available by Viz Media on September 7, 2004. Comic adaptations of the film were also published by Shogakukan and Viz Media. The former released each of the two volumes on August 1, 2002 and September 18, 2002, respectively. The latter issued both on January 1, 2005.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/62\/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":76,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri Telecasting","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/76\/Yomiuri_Telecasting"},{"mal_id":245,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/245\/TOHO"},{"mal_id":1003,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Television Network","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1003\/Nippon_Television_Network"},{"mal_id":1430,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1430\/Shogakukan"},{"mal_id":1492,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri TV Enterprise","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1492\/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/119\/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/14\/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/6\/Mythology"},{"mal_id":78,"type":"anime","name":"Time Travel","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/78\/Time_Travel"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":249,"type":"anime","name":"InuYasha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/249\/InuYasha"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"No More Words\" by Ayumi Hamasaki"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.toho-a-park.com\/video\/new\/inuyasha\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=273"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=294"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/InuYasha_the_Movie"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-278859"},{"name":"Netflix","url":"https:\/\/www.netflix.com\/"}]}}
