It's to get that license and fulfill a promise made to her late father that young Sora Suzuki has made the long journey from her distant home in the countryside town of Biei to the big city of Tokyo. It's a daunting challenge, but she's got a little bit of talent, a charming personality and, most important of all, the promise of an internship! What she ISN'T expecting, though, is how different life in the city will be, especially the people themselves. While she gets along with the confident Asagi, Kuroda and the gentle Hiyori, she's completely confused with the mysterious boy Gouta. And yet, as a result of their internships they keep ending up in the same situations and slowly learning to understand more about each other than they ever imagined possible!\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Universal Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/31\/Geneon_Universal_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"TV Asahi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/55\/TV_Asahi"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/376\/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":34,"type":"anime","name":"Hal Film Maker","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/34\/Hal_Film_Maker"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/63\/Iyashikei"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":5898,"type":"manga","name":"Mahoutsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto: Natsu no Sora","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/5898\/Mahoutsukai_ni_Taisetsu_na_Koto__Natsu_no_Sora"}]},{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":273,"type":"anime","name":"Mahoutsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/273\/Mahoutsukai_ni_Taisetsu_na_Koto"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"fly away\" by THYME"],"endings":["1: \"Kawaita Hana (\u4e7e\u3044\u305f\u82b1)\" by micc (eps 1-11)","2: \"Fly Away\" by THYME (eps 12)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.nbcuni.co.jp\/rondorobe\/anime\/sora-mahou\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=5830"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=9696"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Someday%27s_Dreamers"}],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https:\/\/www.hidive.com\/tv\/somedays-dreamers-ii-sora"}]}}
