The Naturals' deep hatred of the Coordinators drove the advanced beings into space, seeking shelter in man-made colonies.\n\nKira Yamato is a Coordinator and university student on Heliopolis, when his life is thrown into disarray as ZAFT, the military organization composed of rebellious Coordinators, attacks the colony in an effort to steal a set of five state-of-the-art military mobile suits known as Gundams.\n\nWhile ZAFT manages to make off with four of the mobile suits, Kira take control of the final Gundam, the Strike. Surviving the battle, Kira and his college friends join the crew of the Archangel, a ship run by the Earth Alliance, and the young soldiers experience the horrors of war and the loss that comes with it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The HD Remaster of Gundam SEED omits episodes 14 and 26 of the original, therefore having a total of 48 episodes.
