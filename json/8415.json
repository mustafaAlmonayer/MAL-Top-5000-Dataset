There were just the beginning signs of reformation in the long regime of Shogun Tokugawa.\n\nIn the remote countryside, on the island of Shikoko, a young boy named Ryoma is growing up in a lower-class Samurai family. A decade later, he is to become on of the leading figures to topple the Shogun's reign and open Japan to the western world.\n\nOur story begins with Ryoma, a dreaming kid of seven years. Ryoma is an honest and tenderd-hearted boy who hates any sort of violence and brutality. He is so sensitive, and a bit naive, that he often cries from pity when he sees even the simples act of violence such as another kid trampling a tiny insect. The kids and even his family call him a \"cry baby\". However, he is not a coward -- not a \"chicken\" at all. His distress comes from a desire to prevent unreasonable acts and the wrong doings in life.\n\nHis older sister is the only person who understands his depth. She recognizes that her brother is gifted with a special talent and she does her best to protect him and cheer him up.\n\n(Source: Enoki Films USA)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1992,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"17:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 17:30 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":326,"type":"anime","name":"Animation 21","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/326\/Animation_21"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":3146,"type":"manga","name":"Ooi!
