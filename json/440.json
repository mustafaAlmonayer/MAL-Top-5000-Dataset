Devastated, it seemed nothing would calm this poor soul. However, a prince traveling through the area came to see the princess, hoping to cheer her up. After wiping her sorrowful tears, the prince gave her a ring carrying a rose emblem and told her as long as she holds onto the ring, they are destined to meet again. The event leaves a deep impression on the girl, Utena Tenjou, leading her to become a prince herself. \n\nYears later, Utena attends Ootori Academy, recognized by the same rose emblem as her precious ring's. There, attracted by the scent of roses, she witnesses Anthy Himemiya tending the flowers, accompanied by the Student Council President Touga Kiryuu and Vice President Kyouichi Saionji, who seem to be arguing over Anthy. While Utena thinks nothing of the occurrence, the Student Council gathers to discuss an important matter. \n\nSubsequently, a misunderstanding leads to Utena being dragged into the world of Duelists\u2014those with rings similar to her own. The Duelists fight for the ownership of the Rose Bride, Anthy Himemiya, who is said to possess great power. Wanting to prove her capabilities as a prince, and enraged that Anthy is being wronged and objectified, Utena resolves to fight against the Duelists to save her from the cruel fate.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Childhood idealism, illusions, ambition, adulthood, sexuality, abuse, incest and identity are all prominent themes which are explored in what is essentially a highly metaphorical and symbolic coming-of-age story. Loss of innocence, both sexual and otherwise, is treated as a life changing event. Fairy tale archetypes such as the noble prince and the damsel in distress, as well as standard tropes of the shoujo and magical girl genre are incorporated, subverted, inverted, averted and deconstructed. Shoujo Kakumei Utena won the Best TV Animation Award at Animation Kobe in 1997.","season":"spring","year":1997,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":127,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiko Advertising","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/127\/Yomiko_Advertising"},{"mal_id":153,"type":"anime","name":"SoftX","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/153\/SoftX"},{"mal_id":1430,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1430\/Shogakukan"},{"mal_id":1461,"type":"anime","name":"Audio Tanaka","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1461\/Audio_Tanaka"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":217,"type":"anime","name":"Nozomi Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/217\/Nozomi_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":284,"type":"anime","name":"Central Park Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/284\/Central_Park_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/7\/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/46\/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/66\/Mahou_Shoujo"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/40\/Psychological"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":772,"type":"manga","name":"Shoujo Kakumei Utena","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/772\/Shoujo_Kakumei_Utena"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":441,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo Kakumei Utena: Adolescence Mokushiroku","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/441\/Shoujo_Kakumei_Utena__Adolescence_Mokushiroku"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Rinbu Revolution\" by Masami Okui"],"endings":["1: \"Truth\" by Luca Yumi (eps 1-24)","2: \"\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u767a\u751f\u5b66 (Virtual Star Hasseigaku)\" by Maki Kamiya (eps 25-38)","3: \"Rose & release\" by Masami Okui (eps 39)"]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=287"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=207"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Revolutionary_Girl_Utena"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3%E9%9D%A9%E5%91%BD%E3%82%A6%E3%83%86%E3%83%8A"},{"name":"Syoboi","url":"https:\/\/cal.syoboi.jp\/tid\/235"},{"name":"Bangumi","url":"https:\/\/bangumi.tv\/subject\/1453"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-281990"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/www.funimation.com\/shows\/revolutionary-girl-utena"}]}}
