What the Joestars don't realize, however, is that Dario had no intention of helping them; he believed they were dead and was trying to ransack their belongings. After Dario's death 12 years later, George\u2014hoping to repay his debt\u2014adopts his son, Dio. \n\nWhile he publicly fawns over his new father, Dio secretly plans to steal the Joestar fortune. His first step is to create a divide between George and Jonathan. By constantly outdoing his foster brother, Dio firmly makes his place in the Joestar family. But when Dio pushes Jonathan too far, Jonathan defeats him in a brawl. \n\nYears later, the two appear to be close friends to the outside world. But trouble brews again when George falls ill, as Jonathan suspects that Dio is somehow behind the incident\u2014and it appears he has more tricks up his sleeve.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken was announced on July 5, 2012 at a press conference celebrating the 25th anniversary Hirohiko Araki's long-running series.
