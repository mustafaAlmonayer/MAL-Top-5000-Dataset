Thus, when the relatively tame Sorata Kanda is transferred to the dorm, escaping this insane asylum becomes his foremost goal. Trapped there for the time being, he must learn how to deal with his fellow residents, including bubbly animator Misaki Kamiigusa, charming playboy writer Jin Mitaka, and the ever-reclusive Ryuunosuke Akasaka. Surrounded by weirdness, Sorata frequently finds respite in his interactions with his one \"normal\" friend, aspiring voice actress Nanami Aoyama.\n\nWhen Mashiro Shiina\u2014a new foreign exchange student\u2014joins the dormitory, Sorata is instantly enraptured by her beauty. Underneath her otherworldly appearance, Mashiro is an autistic savant, capable of world-renowned brilliance in her art, yet unable to perform simple daily tasks. After Sorata ends up in charge of taking care of Mashiro, the two inevitably grow closer, with Sorata's initial desire to escape the dormitory becoming a forgotten goal.\n\nDespite their eccentricities, every resident is incredible in their own field, leaving Sorata to contend with his own lack of any particular skill. With brilliance all around him, he thus strives to become an equal to their talent. Revolving around the hardships and joys of its colorful cast, Sakura-sou no Pet na Kanojo is a heartwarming coming-of-age tale of friendship, love, ambition, and heartbreak\u2014through the lens of an ordinary person surrounded by the extraordinary.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo adapts the first 6 novels and part of the 7th novel of Hajime Kamoshida's light novel series of the same title.","season":"fall","year":2012,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":61,"type":"anime","name":"Frontier Works","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/61\/Frontier_Works"},{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Genco","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/79\/Genco"},{"mal_id":108,"type":"anime","name":"Media Factory","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/108\/Media_Factory"},{"mal_id":140,"type":"anime","name":"Animax","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/140\/Animax"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/143\/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":681,"type":"anime","name":"ASCII Media Works","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/681\/ASCII_Media_Works"},{"mal_id":737,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Communications","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/737\/Sony_Music_Communications"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/376\/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/7\/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"},{"mal_id":80,"type":"anime","name":"Visual Arts","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/80\/Visual_Arts"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":30051,"type":"manga","name":"Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/30051\/Sakurasou_no_Pet_na_Kanojo"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Kimi ga Yume wo Tsuretekita (\u541b\u304c\u5922\u3092\u9023\u308c\u3066\u304d\u305f)\" by Pet na Kanojo-tachi (Ai Kayano, Mariko Nakatsu, Natsumi Takamori)  (eps 2-10)","2: \"Yume no Tsuzuki (\u5922\u306e\u7d9a\u304d)\" by Konomi Suzuki (eps 13, 16-22, 24)","3: \"I call your name again\" by Nanami Aoyama (Mariko Nakatsu) (eps 14)"],"endings":["Sakurai Takahiro, Kayano Ai, Kawasumi Ayako, Toyoguchi Megumi (ep 23)","1: \"DAYS of DASH\" by Konomi Suzuki (eps 1-12, 24)","2: \"Prime number ~Kimi to Deaeru Hi~ (Prime number\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u51fa\u4f1a\u3048\u308b\u65e5\uff5e)\" by Asuka Ookura (\u5927\u5009\u660e\u65e5\u9999) (eps 13-22)","3: \"Kyou no Hi wa Sayounara (\u4eca\u65e5\u306e\u65e5\u306f\u3055\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3089)\" by Horie Yui, Nakatsu Mariko, Takamori Natsumi, Matsuoka Yoshitsugu,Sakurai Takahiro, Kayano Ai, Kawasumi Ayako, Toyoguchi Megumi  (eps 23)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/sakurasou.tv\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=9153"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=14238"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/\u3055\u304f\u3089\u8358\u306e\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u306a\u5f7c\u5973"}],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https:\/\/www.hidive.com\/tv\/the-pet-girl-of-sakurasou"},{"name":"Netflix","url":"https:\/\/www.netflix.com\/"}]}}
