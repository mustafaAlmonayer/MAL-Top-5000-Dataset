Now, the city is reborn as MegaTokyo, built from the labors of mechanical beasts known as \"Boomers.\" Originally created to benefit humanity, the mysterious corporation known as Genom now produces Boomers with incredible destructive power as a new type of advanced weaponry, capable of disguising themselves as humans.\n\nThe AD Police is a new special unit to counter the ever-increasing Boomer-related crimes. Overwhelmed by the sheer amount of crimes and disparity in strength, the AD Police poses little opposition to the Boomers. A mysterious vigilante force known as the Knight Sabers, wearing powersuits more advanced than the military, is the citizens' only hope for protection. Led by Sylia Stingray, Priscilla \"Priss\" Asagiri, Nene Romanova, and Linna Yamazaki, these beautiful girls take out any Boomer that steps out of line.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":220,"type":"anime","name":"Youmex","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/220\/Youmex"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":310,"type":"anime","name":"AnimEigo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/310\/AnimEigo"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"AIC","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/48\/AIC"},{"mal_id":72,"type":"anime","name":"Artmic","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/72\/Artmic"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/50\/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":568,"type":"anime","name":"Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/568\/Bubblegum_Crisis_Tokyo_2040"}]},{"relation":"Alternative setting","entry":[{"mal_id":1346,"type":"anime","name":"AD Police","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1346\/AD_Police"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1348,"type":"anime","name":"Bubblegum Crash","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1348\/Bubblegum_Crash"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":5036,"type":"anime","name":"Hurricane Live! 2033","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5036\/Hurricane_Live_2033"},{"mal_id":5043,"type":"anime","name":"Hurricane Live! 2032","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5043\/Hurricane_Live_2032"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Konya wa Hurricane (\u4eca\u591c\u306f\u30cf\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30f3)\" by Kinuko Oomori (eps 1)","2: \"Mad Machine\" by Kinuko Oomori (eps 2)","4: \"CRISIS ~ Ikari wo Komete Hashire\" by Yuiko Tsubokura (eps 4)","5: \"Mysterious Night (\u30df\u30b9\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2\u30b9\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8)\" by the Knight Sabers (eps 5)","7: \"Say Yes!\" by Maiko Hashimoto (eps 7)","8: \"Bye Bye My Crisis\" by the Knight Sabers (eps 8)"],"endings":["1: \"Mr. Dandy\" by Bluew (eps 1)","2: \"Kizudarake no Wild (\u50b7\u3060\u3089\u3051\u306eWild)\" by Kinuko Oomori (eps 2)","3: \"Wasurenaide (\u5fd8\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3067)\" by Oomori Kinuko (eps 03)","4: \"Twilight\" by Tsubokura Yuiko (eps 4)","5: \"Omoide ni Dakarete (\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306b\u62b1\u304b\u308c\u3066)\" by Tsubokura Yuiko (eps 5)","6: \"Rock Me\" by Yuiko Tsubokura (eps 6)","7: \"Never the End\" by Maiko Hashimoto (eps 7)","8: \"Chase the Dream\" by Kinuko Oomori (eps 8)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.anime-int.com\/works\/bubblegum\/crisis\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=68"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=201"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bubblegum_Crisis"}],"streaming":[]}}
