At the stroke of midnight, this ominous web domain becomes accessible, and whoever inputs the name of their grudge will get a visit from Ai Enma, the Hell Girl. Ai explains that she will send the target's soul to hell, but the requester will also end up in hell when they die.\n\nFor some, that price is far too steep; for others, where they will spend their afterlife has no bearing on their current, day-to-day hell. But one thing is certain: the Hell Girl will always be available to those in need of revenge, while she stoically performs her duty of ferrying souls into the darkness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2005,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/17\/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":147,"type":"anime","name":"SKY Perfect Well Think","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/147\/SKY_Perfect_Well_Think"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Deen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/37\/Studio_Deen"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/14\/Horror"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/40\/Psychological"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":3243,"type":"manga","name":"Jigoku Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/3243\/Jigoku_Shoujo"},{"mal_id":17987,"type":"manga","name":"Shin Jigoku Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/17987\/Shin_Jigoku_Shoujo"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1594,"type":"anime","name":"Jigoku Shoujo Futakomori","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1594\/Jigoku_Shoujo_Futakomori"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":40667,"type":"anime","name":"Jigoku Shoujo Recap","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/40667\/Jigoku_Shoujo_Recap"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Sakasama no Chou (\u9006\u3055\u307e\u306e\u8776)\" by SNoW"],"endings":["\"Karinui (\u304b\u308a\u306c\u3044)\" by Mamiko Noto"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"https:\/\/www.jigokushoujo.com\/archive\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=3291"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=5577"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jigoku_Shoujo_Futakomori"}],"streaming":[]}}
