Good at both academics and sports on top of being elegant and sociable, she has been an object of admiration all her life. However, in reality, she is an incredibly vain person who toils relentlessly to maintain her good grades, athleticism, and graceful appearance. She wants nothing more than to be the center of attention and praise\u2014which is why she cannot stand Souichirou Arima, the male representative for her class and the only person more perfect than her. Since the first day of high school, she has struggled to steal the spotlight from her new rival but to no avail.\n\nAt last, on the midterm exams, Yukino gets the top score and beats Souichirou. But, to her surprise, he congratulates her on her achievement, leading her to question her deceptive lifestyle. When Souichirou confesses his love to Yukino, she turns him down and gloats about it at home with only a hint of regret. But the very next day, Souichirou visits Yukino house to bring her a CD and sees her uninhibited self in action; now equipped with the truth, he blackmails her into completing his student council duties. Coerced into spending time with Souichirou, Yukino learns that she is not the only one hiding secrets.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1998,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"18:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 18:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":721,"type":"anime","name":"GANSIS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/721\/GANSIS"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":217,"type":"anime","name":"Nozomi Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/217\/Nozomi_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Gainax","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/6\/Gainax"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/7\/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"manga","name":"Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/17\/Kareshi_Kanojo_no_Jijou"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Tenshi no Yubikiri\" by Fukuda Mai"],"endings":["1: \"Yume no Naka e\" by Enomoto Atsuko and Suzuki Chihiro (eps 1-24,26)","2: \"Kaze Hiita Yoru\" by Yuki Watanabe & Maria Yamamoto (eps 25)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.gainax.co.jp\/anime\/karekano\/index.html"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=199"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=392"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kare_Kano"}],"streaming":[]}}
