While the residence itself is fairly normal, most of its occupants are not. Yuusaku Godai, its most quiet tenant, has finally reached his limit with his neighbors' constant disruptions and boisterous partying. Wanting a calmer place to call home so that he can study in peace, he prepares to move away.\n\nHowever, his plans to leave are suddenly interrupted when he meets the new boarding house manager, Kyoko Otonashi. Falling madly in love with her, he decides that the boarding house may not be such a bad place to live after all. Unfortunately for him, Kyoko has her own romantic troubles: she is a widow whose husband died six months into their marriage. And despite her blossoming feelings for Godai, Kyoko still cherishes her dearly departed husband, and she believes that no other man could possibly fill the void in her heart. But with Godai's persistence and some help of the other eccentric tenants, she may experience true love once again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1986,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"19:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 19:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":99,"type":"anime","name":"Kitty Films","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/99\/Kitty_Films"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/169\/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/119\/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Deen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/37\/Studio_Deen"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/50\/Adult_Cast"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":688,"type":"manga","name":"Maison Ikkoku","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/688\/Maison_Ikkoku"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":2459,"type":"anime","name":"Maison Ikkoku: Bangai-hen - Ikkokujima Nanpa Shimatsuki","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2459\/Maison_Ikkoku__Bangai-hen_-_Ikkokujima_Nanpa_Shimatsuki"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":2460,"type":"anime","name":"Maison Ikkoku: Kanketsu-hen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2460\/Maison_Ikkoku__Kanketsu-hen"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":3483,"type":"anime","name":"Maison Ikkoku: Shiki Utsuriyuku Kisetsu no Naka de","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3483\/Maison_Ikkoku__Shiki_Utsuriyuku_Kisetsu_no_Naka_de"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":3484,"type":"anime","name":"Maison Ikkoku: Prelude - Meguru Haru no Sakura no You ni...","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3484\/Maison_Ikkoku__Prelude_-_Meguru_Haru_no_Sakura_no_You_ni"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Kanashimi yo Konnichiwa\" by Yuki Saito (eps 1-23,25-37)","2: \"Alone Again (Naturally)\" by Gilbert O'Sullivan (eps 24)","3: \"Suki sa\" by Anzen Chitai (eps 38-52)","4: \"Sunny Shining Morning\" by Kiyonori Matsuo (eps 53-76)","5: \"Hidamari\" by K\u014dz\u014d Murashita (eps 77-96)"],"endings":["1: \"Ashita Hareru ka\" by Takao Kisugi (eps 1-14)","2: \"Ci \u00b7 ne \u00b7 ma\" by Picasso (eps 15-23,25-33)","3: \"Get Down\" by Gilbert O'Sullivan (eps 24)","4: \"Fantasy\" by Picasso (eps 34-52)","5: \"Sayonara no Soby\u014d\" by Picasso (eps 53-76)","6: \"Begin the Night\" by Picasso (eps 77-96)"]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=288"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=376"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maison_Ikkoku#Anime"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E3%82%81%E3%81%9E%E3%82%93%E4%B8%80%E5%88%BB_(%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1)"},{"name":"Syoboi","url":"https:\/\/cal.syoboi.jp\/tid\/1061"},{"name":"Bangumi","url":"https:\/\/bangumi.tv\/subject\/2921"}],"streaming":[]}}
