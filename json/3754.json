Memoru's people have such tiny bodies that they could stand on a human's palm. One day she hears lovely music, and she follows its source and comes upon a huge house she hasn't seen before to find a girl taller than her playing on the piano. Memoru visited her again secretly with her friends Popitu, Rupangu, and Pi, but the human girl, Marielle, seemed sick and likely to die any moment. Feeling sad for the girl, Memoru's tear drops on the girl's lips. The girl gets better and a strong friendship starts between them. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1984,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"08:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 08:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1415,"type":"anime","name":"Asahi Broadcasting","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1415\/Asahi_Broadcasting"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":12657,"type":"anime","name":"Tongari Boushi no Memole: Marielle no Housekibako","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/12657\/Tongari_Boushi_no_Memole__Marielle_no_Housekibako"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Tongari Boushi no Memoru (\u3068\u3093\u304c\u308a\u5e3d\u5b50\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u30eb)\" by Satoko Yamano"],"endings":["1: \"Yasashii Tomodachi (\u512a\u3057\u3044\u53cb\u9054)\" by Satoko Yamano","2: \"Tongari Boushi no Memoru: Marielle no Houseki Ban (\u3068\u3093\u304c\u308a\u5e3d\u5b50\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u30eb~\u30de\u30ea\u30a8\u30eb\u306e\u5b9d\u77f3\u7248)\" by Satoko Yamano"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.toei-anim.co.jp\/lineup\/tv\/memoru\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1933"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=1391"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tongari_B%C5%8Dshi_no_Memoru"}],"streaming":[]}}
