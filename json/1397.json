Nekki Basara is a guitarist and a singer of the band Fire Bomber. Living in a less-developed part of the flying colony City 7 which is looking for a habitable planet, he composes and sings songs in the belief that music holds a greater power.\n\nDuring its flight, an unknown alien race appeared and started laying siege upon City 7. However, its attacks are not conventional -- instead of trying to destroy them, they steal what is known as \"spiritia\", rendering victims unresponsive and zombie-like. During these battles, Basara always goes out into the middle of the warzone, singing his songs and expecting friend and foe to listen and be moved by his music.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1994,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"11:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 11:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/143\/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":351,"type":"anime","name":"Big West","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/351\/Big_West"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":217,"type":"anime","name":"Nozomi Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/217\/Nozomi_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":242,"type":"anime","name":"Ashi Productions","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/242\/Ashi_Productions"},{"mal_id":2834,"type":"anime","name":"Hero","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/2834\/Hero"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/38\/Military"},{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/19\/Music"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/29\/Space"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":474,"type":"anime","name":"Macross Plus","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/474\/Macross_Plus"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1398,"type":"anime","name":"Macross Dynamite 7","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1398\/Macross_Dynamite_7"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":1399,"type":"anime","name":"Macross 7 Encore","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1399\/Macross_7_Encore"},{"mal_id":1400,"type":"anime","name":"Macross 7 Movie: Ginga ga Ore wo Yondeiru!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1400\/Macross_7_Movie__Ginga_ga_Ore_wo_Yondeiru"},{"mal_id":6209,"type":"anime","name":"Macross 7 Plus","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/6209\/Macross_7_Plus"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":15177,"type":"anime","name":"Macross FB7: Ore no Uta wo Kike!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/15177\/Macross_FB7__Ore_no_Uta_wo_Kike"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Seventh Moon\" by Fire Bomber featuring Basara Nekki"],"endings":["1: \"My Friends\" by Fire Bomber featuring Mylene Jenius (eps 1-34)","2: \"...Dakedo Baby!!
