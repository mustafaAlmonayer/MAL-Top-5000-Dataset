However, when he meets an unusual girl named Misuzu, things take a drastic turn as he is invited to stay with her.\n\nBy staying in the quaint town, Yukito soon becomes friends with the locals. As he gets to know them better, he learns of their problems and decides to help, putting his search for the Winged Maiden on hold.
