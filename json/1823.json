When the war ended, there was only one ruling family - that of the Oowaris, and the remaining son gained control of all the moons of heaven, except for one. Meiten, the moon of the pope, where people refrained from war and were therefore out of it's terms.\n\nEight people. Each from one of the eight moons. Each possessing one of the jewels - the elements that compose Earth. They are those who are destined to become saviors of humanity. All of them have sacrificed for these jewels, and are determined to complete their duty to Queen Fuse who entrusted these to them. When the mad emperor Kai threatens to revive a ghost who wants to prevent the restoration of Earth, these eight must battle using the powers given by their jewels in order to create Earth and defeat those who want to prevent it.\n\nSo they all go to Kusanagi, the ship in the center of God's land. They must gather the jewels in the key called Yatsufusa at Kusanagi's center, in order to create Earth.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1999,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1065,"type":"anime","name":"Public & Basic","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1065\/Public___Basic"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/17\/Martial_Arts"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":["\"Memories\" by angela"],"endings":["1: \"Kitto Onaji Hoshi no Naka de (\u304d\u3063\u3068\u540c\u3058\u661f\u306e\u4e2d\u3067)\" by Friend on mine (eps 1-13)","2: \"Atarashii Hibi Shin Hakkenden Special Mix (\u3042\u305f\u3089\u3057\u3044\u65e5\u3005\u3000\u795e\u516b\u5263\u4f1d\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30b9)\" by RIZ\"CO (eps 14-26)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www4.plala.or.jp\/nscd\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1258"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=1988"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shin_Hakkenden"}],"streaming":[]}}
