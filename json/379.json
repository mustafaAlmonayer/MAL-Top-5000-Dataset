Two young officers, the Excel and her partner Hyatt, are tasked with executing this plan, but standing in their way are the City Security workers, a group consisting of three (mostly) normal guys, a very severe girl, and some robots. Regardless of simplicity, Excel and Hyatt always manage to screw up their missions, which usually result in death and lots of destruction.\n\nHeppoko Jikken Animation Excel\u2665Saga chronicles the elaborate troubles that the ACROSS officers get themselves into, as Excel and Hyatt never fail to do their jobs improperly.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"At the publisher's request, the anime series follows a different storyline from the manga. The twenty-sixth episode Going Too Far was deliberately created to be too violent and obscene for broadcast in Japan and was instead included as a DVD bonus.
