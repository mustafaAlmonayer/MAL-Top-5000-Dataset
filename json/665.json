After seeing his grandfather, Joseph Joestar, and fighting Joseph's friend Muhammad Abdul, Jotaro learns that the \"Spirit\" is actually Star Platinum, his Stand, or fighting energy given a semi-solid form. Later, his mother gains a Stand, and becomes sick. Jotaro learns that it is because the vampire Dio Brando has been revived 100 years after his defeat to Jonathan Joestar, Jotaro's great-great-grandfather. Jotaro decides to join Joseph and Abdul in a trip to Egypt to defeat Dio once and for all.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/460\/KlockWorx"},{"mal_id":1139,"type":"anime","name":"BEAM Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1139\/BEAM_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"APPP","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/77\/APPP"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":32,"type":"anime","name":"Vampire","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/32\/Vampire"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":872,"type":"manga","name":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/872\/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_Part_3__Stardust_Crusaders"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":666,"type":"anime","name":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/666\/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":20899,"type":"anime","name":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/20899\/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_Part_3__Stardust_Crusaders"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=789"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=463"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure#Studio_A.P.P.P."},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%80%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AB%E3%82%BB%E3%82%A4%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9#OVA"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/www.funimation.com\/shows\/jojos-bizarre-adventure"}]}}
