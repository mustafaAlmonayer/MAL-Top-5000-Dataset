Kukuruku builds a castle using dolls transformed from men as building parts. The story revolves around the sorrow and terror of men who have been transfigured into dolls, and a girl named Cherry who wishes to recover the kindness in her brother, who is a student of Kukuruku. This work reminds us of the fact that \"transformation\" or \"transfiguration\" - favorite themes of Tezuka Osamu - involves not only material aspects, but also man's immaterial heart.\n\n(Source: Tezuka Osamu's Website)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":150,"type":"anime","name":"Sanrio","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/150\/Sanrio"},{"mal_id":200,"type":"anime","name":"Tezuka Productions","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/200\/Tezuka_Productions"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/467\/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/11\/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":2427,"type":"anime","name":"Unico","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2427\/Unico"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Do Re Mi Fa Lullaby (\u30c9\u30ec\u30df\u30d5\u30a1\u30fb\u30e9\u30e9\u30d0\u30a4)\" by Emiko Shiratori"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.madhouse.co.jp\/works\/1983-1973\/works_movie_yuniko_mahou.html"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1361"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=629"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-270119"}]}}
