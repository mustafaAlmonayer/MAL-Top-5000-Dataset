Although his mother is allergic to cats and has a great fear of them, she agrees to let him keep the kitten because she fears he is becoming too withdrawn after failing his university entrance exams. Chibi-neko soon falls in love with Tokio.\n\nIn her own mind, Chibi-neko is a small human who speaks in human words, although people only ever seem to hear her meow, and she believes that all humans were once kittens like her. A stray cat tells Chibi-neko of a paradise called Cottonland, where dreams can come true.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":68,"type":"anime","name":"Mushi Production","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/68\/Mushi_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":71,"type":"anime","name":"Pets","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/71\/Pets"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/40\/Psychological"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":9280,"type":"manga","name":"Wata no Kuni Hoshi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/9280\/Wata_no_Kuni_Hoshi"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":37387,"type":"anime","name":"Wata no Kuni Hoshi Pilot","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/37387\/Wata_no_Kuni_Hoshi_Pilot"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Blue Heart (\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30cf\u30fc\u30c8)\" by Yuko Endo"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/columbia.jp\/prod-info\/COBC-90516\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=3575"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=1430"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Star_of_Cottonland"}],"streaming":[]}}
