Whether it's because of his personality or the powers of his horn, no one knows. However, the gods become jealous of Unico, thinking that only gods should be able to decide or let people be happy or not. Unico is banished to the Hill of Oblivion, and the West Wind is ordered to take him there. She can't stand giving this fate to an innocent like Unico, so Unico's adventures begin, as the West Wind takes him from one place and time to the next, in a neverending journey to escape the wrath of the gods. In this adventure, Unico meets Beezel a devil child and then Katy (Chao), a cat who wants to be a witch! Can he become friends with them?\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":150,"type":"anime","name":"Sanrio","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/150\/Sanrio"},{"mal_id":200,"type":"anime","name":"Tezuka Productions","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/200\/Tezuka_Productions"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/467\/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/11\/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":17240,"type":"manga","name":"Unico","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/17240\/Unico"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":2428,"type":"anime","name":"Tanpen Unico: Kuroi Kumo to Shiroi Hane","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2428\/Tanpen_Unico__Kuroi_Kumo_to_Shiroi_Hane"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":2429,"type":"anime","name":"Unico: Mahou no Shima e","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2429\/Unico__Mahou_no_Shima_e"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":23661,"type":"anime","name":"Glass no Chikyuu wo Sukue Unico Special","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/23661\/Glass_no_Chikyuu_wo_Sukue_Unico_Special"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Ai Koso Subete (\u611b\u3053\u305d\u3059\u3079\u3066)\" by Sumie Shima (\u5cf6\u6f84\u6c5f), Buzz"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.madhouse.co.jp\/works\/1983-1973\/works_movie_yuniko.html"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1267"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=628"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unico"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-270041"}]}}
