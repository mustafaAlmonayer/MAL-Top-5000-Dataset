Anyone would think that these two are best friends for life. The only issue is that the tomboyish Tomo is in love with Jun, but he regards her like a brother.\n\nAt the start of their first year of high school, Tomo confesses her feelings to Jun. However, her rough mannerisms and lack of hesitance to throw a punch do nothing to sway Jun's heart. Realizing that he will remain indifferent to her affections unless she does something about it, Tomo must find a way to knock some sense into Jun and open his eyes to what is right in front of him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Tomo-chan wa Onnanoko! was released on Blu-ray and DVD in six volumes from January 25, 2023, to June 28, 2023.","season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/17\/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":701,"type":"anime","name":"Seikaisha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/701\/Seikaisha"},{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1468\/Crunchyroll"},{"mal_id":2640,"type":"anime","name":"INSPION Edge","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/2640\/INSPION_Edge"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1087,"type":"anime","name":"Lay-duce","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1087\/Lay-duce"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":92149,"type":"manga","name":"Tomo-chan wa Onnanoko!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/92149\/Tomo-chan_wa_Onnanoko"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":54925,"type":"anime","name":"Kurae!
