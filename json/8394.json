Together with the scientist Dr. Gilmore, this team of nine cyborgs use their special body modifications to fight against a seemingly endless barrage of enemies, including robotic crabs, aliens, and fellow cyborgs.\n\nEach cyborg has his own special power, which they use in their fight against evil. Titular character 009 (aka Hurricane Joe, the famous race car driver) leads the team with his superhuman strength, resistance to bullets, and ability to accelerate through time. His teammates fight by his side to save humanity from falling into evil hands.\n\nThe team in Cyborg 009 faces many enemies and stops countless threats to their hometown, and even to Earth. No matter what, justice will be served.","background":"Cyborg 009 repurposed the theme songs from the previously released movies, but the show was animated in black and white. It remained fairly true to the source manga, although one character was change into a young child. The anime has obvious visual ties to the groundbreaking Astro Boy, and was marketed in some countries as \"Astro Boy 009\").","season":"spring","year":1968,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1639,"type":"manga","name":"Cyborg 009","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1639\/Cyborg_009"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":1678,"type":"anime","name":"Cyborg 009: The Cyborg Soldier","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1678\/Cyborg_009__The_Cyborg_Soldier"},{"mal_id":4690,"type":"anime","name":"Cyborg 009 (1979)","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/4690\/Cyborg_009_1979"},{"mal_id":11755,"type":"anime","name":"009 Re:Cyborg","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/11755\/009_Re_Cyborg"},{"mal_id":33685,"type":"anime","name":"Cyborg 009: Call of Justice 1","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/33685\/Cyborg_009__Call_of_Justice_1"},{"mal_id":33686,"type":"anime","name":"Cyborg 009: Call of Justice 2","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/33686\/Cyborg_009__Call_of_Justice_2"},{"mal_id":33687,"type":"anime","name":"Cyborg 009: Call of Justice 3","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/33687\/Cyborg_009__Call_of_Justice_3"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":6872,"type":"anime","name":"Cyborg 009","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/6872\/Cyborg_009"},{"mal_id":9629,"type":"anime","name":"Cyborg 009: The Reopening","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/9629\/Cyborg_009__The_Reopening"},{"mal_id":31050,"type":"anime","name":"Cyborg 009 VS Devilman","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/31050\/Cyborg_009_VS_Devilman"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Cyborg 009\" by Tokyo Meistersinger"],"endings":["\"Tatakai Owatte (\u6226\u3044\u304a\u308f\u3063\u3066)\" by Vocal Shop"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.toei-anim.co.jp\/lineup\/tv\/009\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1527"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=1287"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cyborg_009"}],"streaming":[]}}
