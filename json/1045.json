When the elven priestess Celcia Marieclaire casts the spell to send them home, she is interrupted, and the spell is broken into parts that scatter throughout the world. The spell fragments imprint themselves onto the skin of various elves.\n\nThe trio travels in Ritsuko's tank, searching for elves who might carry the spell fragments so that Celcia can transfer them to her own body and make the spell whole again. As they adventure, people begin to refer to them as \"Those Who Hunt Elves,\" gaining a reputation as warriors that put a stop to evil-doers with their miraculous cannon, terrifying elves by stripping any that they find. Though they're not the smartest group, they make up for it with enthusiasm and their strong determination to get back to Japan.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1996,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"01:15","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 01:15 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/64\/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":777,"type":"anime","name":"Showgate","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/777\/Showgate"},{"mal_id":1313,"type":"anime","name":"Amuse","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1313\/Amuse"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/97\/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/376\/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":86,"type":"anime","name":"Group TAC","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/86\/Group_TAC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/9\/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Isekai","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/62\/Isekai"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1910,"type":"manga","name":"Elf wo Karu Mono-tachi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1910\/Elf_wo_Karu_Mono-tachi"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1046,"type":"anime","name":"Elf wo Karu Mono-tachi II","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1046\/Elf_wo_Karu_Mono-tachi_II"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Angel Blue\" by Naoko Hamasaki"],"endings":["\"Tensai wa Saigo ni Yatte Kuru\" by Naoko Hamasaki"]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=79"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=233"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Those_Who_Hunt_Elves"}],"streaming":[]}}
