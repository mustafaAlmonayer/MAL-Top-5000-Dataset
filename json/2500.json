Slipstream\nAbout a Luftwaffe pilot who must choose between his duty to his country: to guard a bomber loaded with Germany's final hope of victory... the world's first atomic bomb... or his duty to the world: to let it fall in flames to enemy Spitfires and be a footnote in history. Of course, things are complicated by the plane's other cargo... the woman he loves. \n\n2. Sonic Boom Squadron\nNear the end of the war, Japan has implemented a new weapon -- a human-piloted rocket-propelled flying bomb. Aboard a bomber carrying one of these, young Ensign Nogami awaits his chance to die as a \"cherry blossom\", a suicide pilot. In a few hours, he will die. The date of his death is set: August 6, 1945.\n\n3. Knight of the Iron Dragon\nTwo soldiers attempt to reach an air base in order to fulfill a promise despite the fact that it might have been rendered moot in the reality of war.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1447,"type":"anime","name":"Urban Vision","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1447\/Urban_Vision"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/11\/Madhouse"}],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/50\/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/38\/Military"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":109302,"type":"manga","name":"Senjou Manga Series","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/109302\/Senjou_Manga_Series"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Kanashii Toki wa Itsumo\" by Hiroyuki Matsuda"]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=813"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=757"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Cockpit_%28film%29"}],"streaming":[]}}
