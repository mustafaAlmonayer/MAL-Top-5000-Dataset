Unfortunately, Enno didn't have the strength to defeat her alone and was forced to call upon Zenki, a powerful protector demon. After Karuma was defeated, Enno sealed Zenki away in a pillar located inside his temple.\n\n1,200 years after this epic battle, Enno's descendant, Chiaki, spends her days showing tourists around her hometown of Shikigami-cho and doing exorcisms to pay the bills. One day, two thieves enter the town in hopes of opening a seal in the Ozuno temple and releasing the hidden treasure from within. However, what actually pops out is a dark entity that attaches itself to the henchmen, transforming them into demonic beings. After this transformation, they begin a rampage through the temple, terrorizing poor Chiaki.\n\nIt is now up to this young progeny to unleash her family's powers to summon Zenki and save Shikigami-cho from these demons, as well as the evil entities sure to follow in their footsteps.","background":null,"season":"winter","year":1995,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":99,"type":"anime","name":"Kitty Films","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/99\/Kitty_Films"},{"mal_id":675,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri Advertising","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/675\/Yomiuri_Advertising"},{"mal_id":1269,"type":"anime","name":"K-Factory","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1269\/K-Factory"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/250\/Media_Blasters"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Deen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/37\/Studio_Deen"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/14\/Horror"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/6\/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":5625,"type":"manga","name":"Kishin Douji Zenki","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/5625\/Kishin_Douji_Zenki"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":5828,"type":"anime","name":"Kishin Douji Zenki Gaiden: Anki Kitan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5828\/Kishin_Douji_Zenki_Gaiden__Anki_Kitan"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Kishin Douji ZENKI\" by Hironobu Kageyama (eps 1-28)","2: \"Chou Kishin ZENKI, Raigou Shourin!\" by Hironobu Kageyama (eps 29-49)"],"endings":["1: \"Egao wo Ageru; Give a Smile\" by Hitomi Takimoto (eps 1-22)","2: \"Sleepless Angels ~Nemurenu Yoru no Tenshi-tachi~\" by Chisa Yokoyama (eps 23-38)","3: \"Kiseki no Chou Kishin\" by Chisa Yokoyama & Megumi Ogata (eps 39-49)","4: \"Kishin Douji ZENKI\" by Hironobu Kageyama (eps 51)"]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=558"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=333"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zenki"}],"streaming":[]}}
