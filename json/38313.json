In the hopes of befriending the twins, Heine and the four princes meet their visitors, but their efforts are thwarted instantly when the two twin princes declare that they refuse to address those who will never reach the throne. Dispersing the tension between the boys, Heine reveals that he, upon their father King Victor von Grannzreich's request, will be tutoring the Romano princes alongside the Grannzreichs for the duration of their stay, in hopes of strengthening the future relations between the two kingdoms.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/64\/Sotsu"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1890,"type":"anime","name":"Tear Studio","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1890\/Tear_Studio"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":75243,"type":"manga","name":"Oushitsu Kyoushi Heine","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/75243\/Oushitsu_Kyoushi_Heine"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":34262,"type":"anime","name":"Oushitsu Kyoushi Heine","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/34262\/Oushitsu_Kyoushi_Heine"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Parallel naKankei (\u30d1\u30e9\u30ec\u30eb\u306a\u95a2\u4fc2)\" by Shougo Sakamoto"],"endings":["\"Tomodachi Ijou x Teki Miman (\u201c\u53cb\u9054 \u4ee5\u4e0a\u00d7 \u6575 \u672a\u6e80\u201d)\" by P4 with T"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"https:\/\/heine-movie.com\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=14394"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=21403"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Royal_Tutor"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-272907"}]}}
