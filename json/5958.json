That day, Tomoki's peaceful life is changed forever when a strange girl falls from the sky and begins to call him master.\n \nSora no Otoshimono follows the daily activities of the New World Discovery Club as they begin to learn more about the Angeloids that have arrived on Earth.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2009,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/113\/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":352,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Pictures Japan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/352\/Kadokawa_Pictures_Japan"},{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/460\/KlockWorx"},{"mal_id":689,"type":"anime","name":"NTT Docomo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/689\/NTT_Docomo"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":88,"type":"anime","name":"AIC ASTA","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/88\/AIC_ASTA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/9\/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/35\/Harem"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":8144,"type":"manga","name":"Sora no Otoshimono","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/8144\/Sora_no_Otoshimono"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":7858,"type":"anime","name":"Sora no Otoshimono: Project Pink","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/7858\/Sora_no_Otoshimono__Project_Pink"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Ring My Bell (Main Vocal Hitomi)\" by Blue Drops (eps 1-10, 12)","2: \"Ring My Bell (Main Vocal Saori)\" by Blue Drops (eps 11)"],"endings":["1: \"Soba ni Irareru Dake de (\u305d\u3070\u306b\u3044\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3067 )\" by Blue Drops (eps 1)","2: \"Misaki Meguri (\u5cac\u3081\u3050\u308a)\" by Mina (eps 2)","3: \"Taiyou ga Kureta Kisetsu (\u592a\u967d\u304c\u304f\u308c\u305f\u5b63\u7bc0)\" by Hayami Saori, Mina, Takagaki Ayahi, Hoshi Souichirou, and Suzuki Tatsuhisa (eps 3)","4: \"Senshi no Kyuusoku (\u6226\u58eb\u306e\u4f11\u606f)\" by Hoshi Souichirou (eps 4)","5: \"Yuke!
