Senbei Norimaki is one of these humans, and he's an inventor with the lofty dream of creating the world's best robot girl. \n\nThe product of his efforts is Arale, but depending on your definition of perfect, she's anything but! Not only is Arale severely nearsighted, but she also has no common sense! At least she has super-strength, though that often proves to be a setback as well. \n\nAlthough she means well, Arale only causes trouble for her neighbors in the whimsical Penguin Village!","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1997,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/169\/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":57,"type":"anime","name":"Gag Humor","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/57\/Gag_Humor"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":796,"type":"manga","name":"Dr. Slump","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/796\/Dr_Slump"}]},{"relation":"Character","entry":[{"mal_id":223,"type":"anime","name":"Dragon Ball","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/223\/Dragon_Ball"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":2222,"type":"anime","name":"Dr. Slump: Arale-chan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2222\/Dr_Slump__Arale-chan"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":8550,"type":"anime","name":"Dr. Slump Movie 10: Arale no Bikkuriman","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/8550\/Dr_Slump_Movie_10__Arale_no_Bikkuriman"},{"mal_id":30449,"type":"anime","name":"Dr. Slump: Robot Taiketsu!
