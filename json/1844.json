Funded entirely out of its own deep pockets, it was hoped that the school would be a haven for young men and women on whose shoulders our future would rest.\n\nThe School is open to any talented individual, irrespective of his or her lineage or financial standing and is known to count scores of singularly talented pupils. It is furthermore also famous for its harboring of a remarkable percentage of party animals. Not even the bright and talented minds of CLAMP School can keep the campus free of crimes and mysteries. Or can they? Join Nokoru, Suoh and Akira, our case-cracking kid detectives, as they save the day and even the odd damsel in distress!\n\n(Source: Bandai Entertainment)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1997,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/23\/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/233\/Bandai_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":490,"type":"anime","name":"Maiden Japan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/490\/Maiden_Japan"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1\/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":130,"type":"manga","name":"Clamp Gakuen Tanteidan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/130\/Clamp_Gakuen_Tanteidan"},{"mal_id":307,"type":"manga","name":"Gakuen Tokukei Duklyon","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/307\/Gakuen_Tokukei_Duklyon"},{"mal_id":552,"type":"manga","name":"20 Mensou ni Onegai!!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/552\/20_Mensou_ni_Onegai"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":6107,"type":"anime","name":"Aruhi no Clamp Gakuen Tanteidan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/6107\/Aruhi_no_Clamp_Gakuen_Tanteidan"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Peony Pink\" by ALI PROJECT"],"endings":["1: \"Youkoso Metallic Party\" by Marble Berry (eps 01-19)","2: \"Gift\" by Sakamoto Maaya (eps 20-26)"]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=841"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=130"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Clamp_School_Detectives"}],"streaming":[]}}
