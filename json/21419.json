Conan Edogawa, who happened to be visiting as the murder occurred, rushes to apprehend the sniper but fails to do so. He later learns that the suspect for the incident, Timothy Hunter, is a former member of the Navy Special Ops squad and was already being investigated for a previous murder case. The FBI believes that there are at least three people Timothy wants dead. However, after the deaths of two of them, Timothy himself is killed, throwing the investigation into disarray.\n\nAs they lose their only lead, news about the assassinations spreads across Tokyo, leaving the city in a state of panic. It is up to Conan to find and catch the culprit in the hope of putting an end to this sniping spree terror.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":73,"type":"anime","name":"TMS Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/73\/TMS_Entertainment"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/39\/Detective"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":109216,"type":"manga","name":"Meitantei Conan: Ijigen no Sniper","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/109216\/Meitantei_Conan__Ijigen_no_Sniper"}]},{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":235,"type":"anime","name":"Detective Conan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/235\/Detective_Conan"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":24169,"type":"anime","name":"Detective Conan: The Fugitive Kogorou Mouri","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/24169\/Detective_Conan__The_Fugitive_Kogorou_Mouri"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Love Searchlight\" by Kou Shibasaki"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.conan-movie.jp\/index.html"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=10290"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=15794"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-281139"}]}}
