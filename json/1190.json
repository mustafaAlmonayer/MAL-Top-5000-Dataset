The infamous \"training from Hell\" first tests the members as they run all the way up toward the mountainside club. Shortly after, they participate in specialized tennis practice that matches their specific playstyles. With the threat of Sadaharu Inui's new \"Marvelous Surprise Inui Juice Excellent\" awaiting any who fail to complete their daily tasks, the boys persevere through their exhaustion. \n\nA group of ill-mannered university students also arrive at the resort and demand to use the courts initially reserved for Seishun. Annoyed by their arrogance, Ryouma Echizen single-handedly challenges them to a match, with the winner claiming the right to the courts. Can the young freshman \"super rookie\" defeat the pompous team by himself?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/10\/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/30\/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Tennis no Oujisama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/22\/Tennis_no_Oujisama"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=56"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=5391"}],"streaming":[]}}
