One day, Clain finds an injured girl called Phryne under a cliff. She disappears leaving a pendant. Clain sets out for a journey with the girl-shaped avatar Nessa to look for Phryne and discovers the secret of the Fractale System.","background":"Fractale aired on Fuji Television's noitaminA block. On June 19, 2011, Mutsumi Akazaki, who drew the manga adaptation of Fractale, stated in a blog post that she found the work 'uninteresting' and added that she wanted to work on a manga that she enjoyed. The blog post was soon removed. As a result, the anime's director Yutaka Yamamoto requested that the production committee discontinue the manga series, though there was no indication that this was approved. Akazaki later apologised for the remark.","season":"winter","year":2011,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"00:45","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 00:45 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/169\/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":245,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/245\/TOHO"},{"mal_id":517,"type":"anime","name":"Asmik Ace","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/517\/Asmik_Ace"},{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/757\/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":56,"type":"anime","name":"A-1 Pictures","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/56\/A-1_Pictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":22900,"type":"manga","name":"Fractale","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/22900\/Fractale"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Harinezumi (\u30cf\u30ea\u30cd\u30ba\u30df)\" by Azuma Hitomi"],"endings":["1: \"Down By The Salley Gardens\" by Azuma Hitomi (eps 1-4,9-11)","2: \"Salley Garden \"(\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3)\" by Azuma Hitomi (eps 5-8)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/fractale.noitamina.tv\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=7873"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=11796"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fractale"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-273875"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/www.funimation.com\/shows\/fractale"}]}}
