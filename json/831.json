They make the wind blow, the snow fall, the sun shine; if it's something weather related, they are the ones who make it happen. \n\nSugar, an apprentice Snow Fairy, and her friends Salt and Pepper, all want to become full-fledged Season Fairies, and the only way to achieve this is to search for and find the \"Twinkles\" that will make their magical flowers bloom. The only problem is that none of them have any idea what a Twinkle is. \n\nThey enlist the somewhat unwilling help of Saga, a human girl who can see Season Fairies. Much to her annoyance, Saga's perfectly planned and ordered life has just become a little too lively for her taste. Together, they search for the mysterious Twinkles while trying to perfect their magic.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2001,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/113\/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":116,"type":"anime","name":"Broccoli","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/116\/Broccoli"},{"mal_id":145,"type":"anime","name":"TBS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/145\/TBS"},{"mal_id":204,"type":"anime","name":"Pioneer LDC","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/204\/Pioneer_LDC"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/376\/Sentai_Filmworks"},{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1459\/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/7\/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":3167,"type":"manga","name":"Chicchana Yukitsukai Sugar","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/3167\/Chicchana_Yukitsukai_Sugar"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1014,"type":"anime","name":"Chicchana Yukitsukai Sugar Specials","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1014\/Chicchana_Yukitsukai_Sugar_Specials"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Sugar Baby Love\" by Yoko Ishida"],"endings":["\"Snow Flower\" by Maria Yamamoto"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.tbs.co.jp\/snow-sugar\/main.html"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=9"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=1018"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tiny_Snow_Fairy_Sugar"}],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https:\/\/www.hidive.com\/tv\/a-little-snow-fairy-sugar"}]}}
