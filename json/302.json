After 20 years, most of the castaways have died, save for Conan and the wise old man that raised him.\n\nBelieving Remnant Island to be the last inhabited place on Earth, Conan is shocked when he discovers a young girl named Lana washed up on the beach one day. Though he is thrilled to learn that humanity has survived, Lana tells him the nation of Industria wants her as a hostage to force her grandfather, Dr. Lao, to power their machinery. Their conversation is cut short when Industria's top pilot, Monsley, suddenly appears and seizes Lana. Determined to save her, Conan immediately sets off from Remnant Island and begins a journey that will ultimately determine the fate of the world. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Inspired by the novel \"The Incredible Tide\" by Alexander Key, released in 1970.","season":"spring","year":1978,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"19:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 19:30 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":783,"type":"anime","name":"GKIDS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/783\/GKIDS"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/22\/Nippon_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":2613,"type":"anime","name":"Mirai Shounen Conan 2: Taiga Daibouken","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2613\/Mirai_Shounen_Conan_2__Taiga_Daibouken"}]},{"relation":"Alternative setting","entry":[{"mal_id":2613,"type":"anime","name":"Mirai Shounen Conan 2: Taiga Daibouken","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2613\/Mirai_Shounen_Conan_2__Taiga_Daibouken"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":2614,"type":"anime","name":"Mirai Shounen Conan: Kyodaiki Gigant no Fukkatsu","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2614\/Mirai_Shounen_Conan__Kyodaiki_Gigant_no_Fukkatsu"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":7308,"type":"anime","name":"Mirai Shounen Conan (Movie)","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/7308\/Mirai_Shounen_Conan_Movie"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Ima Chikyuu ga Mezameru (\u4eca\u5730\u7403\u304c\u3081\u3056\u3081\u308b)\" by Naozuki Kamada and Yuuko Yamaji"],"endings":["\"Shiawase no Yokan (\u5e78\u305b\u306e\u4e88\u611f)\" by Naozuki Kamada and Yuuko Yamaji"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.nausicaa.net\/miyazaki\/conan\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=330"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=899"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Future_Boy_Conan"}],"streaming":[]}}
