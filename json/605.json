Then one day, the cute and behaloed Noelle fell, quite literally, into his life, naked as a baby and every bit as innocent. Before he can even fathom what's just happened, Yuusuke is inducted into a rather odd family of otherworldly beings. \n\nPapa is a Frankenstein monster with a taste for calisthenics. Mama is a gorgeous lady with a penchant for \"round objects\" -- really! The eldest sister, Sara, is literally invisible; the brother, Gabriel, is a teenage vampire with an attitude problem; and the youngest sister, Ruka, loves inventing things. There's a disapproving Grandma, who's a witch to the nth degree, and her vulture familiar. All Yuusuke wanted was for the beautiful Natsumi to even notice his attention, but now he has an angel-in-training to follow him wherever he goes. And Noelle, too, has a guide on her path to being an angel, the mysterious Michael.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1999,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":116,"type":"anime","name":"Broccoli","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/116\/Broccoli"},{"mal_id":127,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiko Advertising","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/127\/Yomiko_Advertising"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":1474,"type":"anime","name":"Synch-Point","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1474\/Synch-Point"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1\/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":32,"type":"anime","name":"Vampire","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/32\/Vampire"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":2569,"type":"manga","name":"Tenshi ni Naru mon!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/2569\/Tenshi_ni_Naru_mon"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Datte, Daisuki!\" by COMA"],"endings":["\"Ai wa Umi\" by Shizuru Ootaka"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/pierrot.jp\/title\/tenshi\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=690"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=278"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tenshi_ni_Narumon"}],"streaming":[]}}
