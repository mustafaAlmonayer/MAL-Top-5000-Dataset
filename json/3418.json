Anyway, to protect animals from poachers, Ta-chan is fighting against them with his disciple, Pedro, and a master of Chinese martial arts, Ryo.\n\nThis anime is based on the manga with the same title; it begins as a comical parody of Tarzan. The first several episodes are comedies, but the rest of the series consists of (rather) serious episodes.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1993,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":86,"type":"anime","name":"Group TAC","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/86\/Group_TAC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":57,"type":"anime","name":"Gag Humor","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/57\/Gag_Humor"},{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/20\/Parody"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":23279,"type":"manga","name":"Jungle no Ouja Tar-chan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/23279\/Jungle_no_Ouja_Tar-chan"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Heart no Keijou (HEART\u306e\u5f62\u72b6)\" by B\u2200G (eps 1-30)","2: \"mama I Love You\" by B\u2200G (eps 31-50)"],"endings":["1: \"VIRGIN LAND\" by Ann Lewis (eps 1-26)","2: \"MISTY HEARTBREAK\" by access (eps 27-38)","3: \"JINGLE JUNGLE DANCE\" by Ann Lewis (eps 39-50)"]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4040"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=119"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jungle_King_Tar-chan"}],"streaming":[]}}
