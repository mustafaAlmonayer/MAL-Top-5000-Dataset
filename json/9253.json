Despite claims of grandeur, the only notable \"gadget\" the trio have created is a microwave that has the mystifying power to turn bananas into green goo.\n\nHowever, when Rintarou decides to attend neuroscientist Kurisu Makise's conference on time travel, he experiences a series of strange events that lead him to believe that there is more to the \"Phone Microwave\" gadget than meets the eye. Apparently able to send text messages into the past using the microwave, Rintarou dabbles further with the \"time machine,\" attracting the ire and attention of the mysterious organization SERN.\n\nDue to the novel discovery, Rintarou and his friends find themselves in an ever-present danger. As he works to mitigate the damage his invention has caused to the timeline, he is not only fighting a battle to save his loved ones, but also one against his degrading sanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Steins;Gate is based on 5pb. and Nitroplus' visual novel of the same title released in 2009.
