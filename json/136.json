They have access to otherwise unavailable funds and information that allow them to pursue their dreams and interests. However, being a hunter is a special privilege, only attained by taking a deadly exam with an extremely low success rate.\n\nGon Freecss, a 12-year-old boy with the hope of finding his missing father, sets out on a quest to take the Hunter Exam. Along the way, he picks up three companions who also aim to take the dangerous test: the revenge-seeking Kurapika, aspiring doctor Leorio Paladiknight, and a mischievous child the same age as Gon, Killua Zoldyck.\n\nAs the four aspiring hunters embark on a perilous adventure, they fight for their dreams while defying the odds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1999,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/169\/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/119\/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/22\/Nippon_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":26,"type":"manga","name":"Hunter x Hunter","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/26\/Hunter_x_Hunter"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":137,"type":"anime","name":"Hunter x Hunter: Original Video Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/137\/Hunter_x_Hunter__Original_Video_Animation"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":10189,"type":"anime","name":"Hunter x Hunter Pilot","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/10189\/Hunter_x_Hunter_Pilot"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":11061,"type":"anime","name":"Hunter x Hunter (2011)","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/11061\/Hunter_x_Hunter_2011"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Ohayou (\u304a\u306f\u3088\u3046)\" by Keno (eps 1-48)","2: \"Taiyou wa Yoru mo Kagayaku (\u592a\u967d\u306f\u591c\u3082\u8f1d\u304f)\" by Wino (eps 49-62)"],"endings":["1: \"Kaze no Uta; Song of the Wind\" by Minako Honda (eps 1-31)","2: \"E-Jan - Do You Feel Like I Feel\" by Masato Nagai (eps 32-52)","3: \"Hotaru\" by Masato Nagai (eps 53-62)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.nippon-animation.co.jp\/na\/hunter\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=132"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=1134"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter_(1999_TV_series)"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/HUNTER%C3%97HUNTER_(1999%E5%B9%B4%E3%81%AE%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1)"},{"name":"Syoboi","url":"https:\/\/cal.syoboi.jp\/tid\/927"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/www.funimation.com\/shows\/hunter-x-hunter"}]}}
