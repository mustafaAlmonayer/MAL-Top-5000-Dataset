However, this is of little concern to superpowered high school student Eiko Magami, who only cares about her best friend Shiiko Kotobuki and arriving at school on time. Unfortunately, the incredibly intelligent Biko Daitokuji intends to befriend Shiiko, taking Eiko's place as the Shiiko's best friend using any means she can.\n\nBiko decides that, to accomplish this, she must defeat Eiko in combat. In order to overcome her super strength and speed, Biko creates a mecha and challenges Eiko in front of their school gate. As the two commence their battle, an extremely large spaceship hovers over Earth, searching for something left behind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1372,"type":"anime","name":"Soeishinsha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1372\/Soeishinsha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":284,"type":"anime","name":"Central Park Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/284\/Central_Park_Media"},{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/467\/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"APPP","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/77\/APPP"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/31\/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":1295,"type":"anime","name":"A-Ko The Versus","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1295\/A-Ko_The_Versus"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1296,"type":"anime","name":"Project A-Ko 2: Daitokuji Zaibatsu no Inbou","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1296\/Project_A-Ko_2__Daitokuji_Zaibatsu_no_Inbou"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Follow Your Dream\" by Valerie Stevenson"]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=281"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=61"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Project_A-ko"}],"streaming":[]}}
