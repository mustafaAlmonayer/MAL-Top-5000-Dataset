At the same time in New York, the ambitious scientist Szilard and his unwilling aide Ennis are looking for missing bottles of the immortality elixir. In addition, a war between the mafia groups is getting worse. On board the Advena Avis, in 1711, alchemists are about to learn the price of immortality.\n\nBased on the award-winning light novels of the same name, Baccano! follows several events that initially seem unrelated, both in time and place, but are part of a much bigger story\u2014one of alchemy, survival, and immortality. Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Baccano! is based on Ryohgo Narita's award-winning light novels of the same title and mainly adapts the first 4 novels. While more faithful to the first 3 novels, the 4th novel (1932) is followed more loosely and is mostly an anime-exclusive story. In addition, content from later novels is briefly included in the anime as well. Unlike the novels however, which follow a mostly linear narrative per book, the anime adopts a non-linear storytelling style; the tale of each novel is told simultaneously with one another, with the focus jumping back and forth in time between and within the different plotlines.","season":"summer","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/17\/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":765,"type":"anime","name":"Sakura Create","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/765\/Sakura_Create"},{"mal_id":787,"type":"anime","name":"Happinet Pictures","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/787\/Happinet_Pictures"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"},{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/493\/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Brain's Base","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/112\/Brains_Base"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"},{"mal_id":68,"type":"anime","name":"Organized Crime","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/68\/Organized_Crime"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1342,"type":"manga","name":"Baccano!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1342\/Baccano"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":3901,"type":"anime","name":"Baccano!
