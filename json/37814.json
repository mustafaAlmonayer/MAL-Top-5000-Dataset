It is a remake of the original Inazuma Eleven episode 27.\n\nAfter defeating Zeus and becoming the Football Frontier champions, the members of Raimon return to the soccer club. Unlike episode 27, the club is not invaded by aliens. Instead, everyone congratulates the team members for their remarkable achievements.\n\nKidou Yuuto and Gouenji Shuuya then propose to take on the world. Hibiki Seigou comes in and, incidentially, proposes a match between Raimon and the Spanish youth league champion, Barcelona Orb.\n\n(Source: Inazuma Eleven Wiki)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/28\/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/30\/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/31\/Super_Power"},{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"Team Sports","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/77\/Team_Sports"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":113275,"type":"manga","name":"Inazuma Eleven: Reloaded","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/113275\/Inazuma_Eleven__Reloaded"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":5231,"type":"anime","name":"Inazuma Eleven","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5231\/Inazuma_Eleven"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":33733,"type":"anime","name":"Inazuma Eleven: Ares no Tenbin","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/33733\/Inazuma_Eleven__Ares_no_Tenbin"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Tachiagariyo (Reloaded Ver.)
