On top of all this, he wakes up one morning to find himself kidnapped and tied up by his girlfriend Hitagi Senjougahara. Having run afoul of Deishuu Kaiki, a swindler who conned Senjougahara's family, she has taken it upon herself to imprison Araragi to keep him safe from the con man. But when Araragi gets a frantic message from his sister Karen, he learns that the fraud has set his sights on her.\n\nAlong with Karen's troubles, his other sister, Tsukihi, is having issues of her own. And when two mysterious women who seem to know more than they should about Araragi and his special group of friends step into their lives, not even he could anticipate their true goals, nor the catastrophic truths soon to be revealed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Nisemonogatari adapts the fourth and fifth volumes of NisiOisiN's Monogatari Series: First Season.","season":"winter","year":2012,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/17\/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/159\/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":211,"type":"anime","name":"Rakuonsha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/211\/Rakuonsha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/493\/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":44,"type":"anime","name":"Shaft","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/44\/Shaft"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/9\/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":14893,"type":"manga","name":"Monogatari Series: First Season","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/14893\/Monogatari_Series__First_Season"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":5081,"type":"anime","name":"Bakemonogatari","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5081\/Bakemonogatari"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":17074,"type":"anime","name":"Monogatari Series: Second Season","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/17074\/Monogatari_Series__Second_Season"}]},{"relation":"Character","entry":[{"mal_id":23831,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica Movie 3: Hangyaku no Monogatari - Magica Quartet x Nisioisin","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/23831\/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka\u2605Magica_Movie_3__Hangyaku_no_Monogatari_-_Magica_Quartet_x_Nisioisin"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":32268,"type":"anime","name":"Koyomimonogatari","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/32268\/Koyomimonogatari"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":36725,"type":"anime","name":"Naisho no Hanashi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/36725\/Naisho_no_Hanashi"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Futakotome (\u4e8c\u8a00\u76ee)\" by Hitagi Senjougahara (Chiwa Saito) (eps TV Broadcast and BD\/DVD: eps 1, 3)","2: \"marshmallow justice\" by Karen Araragi (Eri Kitamura) (eps TV Broadcast: eps 2, 5-6; BD\/DVD: eps 2, 4-7)","3: \"Hakkin Disco (\u767d\u91d1\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30b3)\" by Tsukihi Araragi (Yuka Iguchi) (eps TV Broadcast: eps 8-10; BD\/DVD: eps 8-11)"],"endings":["\"Naisho no Hanashi (\u30ca\u30a4\u30b7\u30e7\u306e\u8a71)\" by ClariS"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.nisemonogatari-anime.com\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=8658"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=13556"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bakemonogatari"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-240610"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/www.funimation.com\/shows\/nisemonogatari"}]}}
