The only defense against these creatures is the secret agency known as the Gutsy Geoid Guard (or 3G) and their ultimate weapon, the awesome giant robot GaoGaiGar. GaoGaiGar's pilot, Guy Shishio, is a former astronaut who was nearly killed two years before when the Zonders first crashed to earth. Guy's life was spared when a mysterious robot lion called Galeon pulled him from the burning shuttle and brought him to Earth. Guy's father, Leo, then used Galeon's technology to rebuild his shattered son as a cyborg, in the hopes that he could stop the aliens when they appear. Now, with Galeon as its core, GaoGaiGar fights to protect Earth. He is aided by a team of transforming robots and by a young boy named Mamoru, who has the power to purify the Zonders' cores, and seems to be connected to the mysterious Galeon. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"winter","year":1997,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"17:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 17:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":123,"type":"anime","name":"Victor Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/123\/Victor_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1366,"type":"anime","name":"Nagoya Broadcasting Network","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1366\/Nagoya_Broadcasting_Network"},{"mal_id":2817,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyu Agency","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/2817\/Tokyu_Agency"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/250\/Media_Blasters"},{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/467\/Discotek_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/14\/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/31\/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":13824,"type":"manga","name":"King of Braves GaoGaiGar FINAL the COMIC","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/13824\/King_of_Braves_GaoGaiGar_FINAL_the_COMIC"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1382,"type":"anime","name":"Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar Final","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1382\/Yuusha-Ou_GaoGaiGar_Final"},{"mal_id":4416,"type":"anime","name":"Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar Final Grand Glorious Gathering","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/4416\/Yuusha-Ou_GaoGaiGar_Final_Grand_Glorious_Gathering"}]},{"relation":"Alternative setting","entry":[{"mal_id":2803,"type":"anime","name":"Densetsu no Yuusha da Garn","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2803\/Densetsu_no_Yuusha_da_Garn"},{"mal_id":3325,"type":"anime","name":"Yuusha Exkaiser","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3325\/Yuusha_Exkaiser"},{"mal_id":3486,"type":"anime","name":"Yuusha Tokkyuu Might Gaine","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3486\/Yuusha_Tokkyuu_Might_Gaine"},{"mal_id":3505,"type":"anime","name":"Yuusha Shirei Dagwon","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3505\/Yuusha_Shirei_Dagwon"},{"mal_id":4532,"type":"anime","name":"Taiyou no Yuusha Fighbird","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/4532\/Taiyou_no_Yuusha_Fighbird"},{"mal_id":5075,"type":"anime","name":"Yuusha Keisatsu J-Decker","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5075\/Yuusha_Keisatsu_J-Decker"},{"mal_id":5440,"type":"anime","name":"Ougon Yuusha Goldran","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5440\/Ougon_Yuusha_Goldran"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":52383,"type":"anime","name":"Yuusha-Ou GaoGaiGar: Blockaded Numbers","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/52383\/Yuusha-Ou_GaoGaiGar__Blockaded_Numbers"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Yuusha-oh Tanjou\" by Masaaki Endoh"],"endings":["\"Itsuka houshi no umi de\" by Satoko Shimonari"]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=957"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=1170"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gaogaigar"}],"streaming":[]}}
