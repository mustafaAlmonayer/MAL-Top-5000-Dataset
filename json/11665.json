His most important ally is still his gluttonous and sake-loving bodyguard, the arrogant but fiercely protective wolf spirit Madara\u2014or Nyanko-sensei, as Madara is called when in his usual disguise of an unassuming, pudgy cat.\n\nNatsume, while briefly separated from Nyanko-sensei, is ambushed and kidnapped by a strange group of masked, monkey-like youkai, who have spirited him away to their forest as they desperately search for the Book of Friends. Realizing that his \"servant\" has been taken out from right under his nose, Nyanko-sensei enlists the help of Natsume's youkai friends and mounts a rescue operation. However, the forest of the monkey spirits holds many dangerous enemies, including the Matoba Clan, Natsume's old nemesis.\n\nStretching from the formidable hideout of the Matoba to Natsume's own childhood home, Natsume Yuujinchou Shi is a sweeping but familiar return to a world of danger and friendship, where Natsume will finally confront the demons of his own past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2012,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"01:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 01:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/17\/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/139\/Nihon_Ad_Systems"},{"mal_id":148,"type":"anime","name":"Hakusensha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/148\/Hakusensha"},{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/757\/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":372,"type":"anime","name":"NIS America, Inc.","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/372\/NIS_America_Inc"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Brain's Base","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/112\/Brains_Base"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/63\/Iyashikei"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/6\/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1859,"type":"manga","name":"Natsume Yuujinchou","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1859\/Natsume_Yuujinchou"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":10379,"type":"anime","name":"Natsume Yuujinchou San","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/10379\/Natsume_Yuujinchou_San"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":18849,"type":"anime","name":"Natsume Yuujinchou: Nyanko-sensei to Hajimete no Otsukai","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/18849\/Natsume_Yuujinchou__Nyanko-sensei_to_Hajimete_no_Otsukai"},{"mal_id":20651,"type":"anime","name":"Natsume Yuujinchou: Itsuka Yuki no Hi ni","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/20651\/Natsume_Yuujinchou__Itsuka_Yuki_no_Hi_ni"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":32983,"type":"anime","name":"Natsume Yuujinchou Go","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/32983\/Natsume_Yuujinchou_Go"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Ima, Kono Toki.
