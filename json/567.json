It remains populated by forgotten pasts and the ruins of their labors due to a calamity 40 years ago. Shrouded in a fog-like mystery, it is up to people like Roger Smith to shine a light through the mist. Acting as a professional negotiator and suave agent, Roger is a self-tailored ladies man whose only love is for funeral black. However, as he gets deeply involved with his clients, what often starts as a simple negotiation evolves into Roger saving Paradigm from crime and peril.\n\nIn the process, Roger stumbles even deeper into the untold folds of the city. As a rule, things are hardly ever as they appear. Serving as gray knight in a gray world, Roger is not without allies. By his side are Norman, a loyal and widely skilled butler, and Dorothy, a human-like android with deadpan snark. Together with the relic Big O, a jet-black mecha of gargantuan size and weight, they help Roger serve iron justice to Paradigm's lurking villains as he discovers the truth about 40 years ago.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":1999,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/23\/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/233\/Bandai_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/376\/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/14\/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/40\/Psychological"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":283,"type":"manga","name":"The Big O","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/283\/The_Big_O"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Big-O!\" by Rui Nagai (3-13)","2: \"Respect\" by Sahashi (15-20, 22-25)"],"endings":["\"And Forever...\" by Robbie Danzie with Naoki Takao"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.the-big-o.net\/index.html"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=904"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=231"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Big_O"}],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https:\/\/www.hidive.com\/tv\/the-big-o"}]}}
