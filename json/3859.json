Although this cutting-edge technology is responsible for solving various murder cases, it has raised several ethical concerns, placing Section Nine\u2014the police division in charge of the MRI investigations led by Tsuyoshi Maki\u2014under considerable pressure from the media and the government. The team members of Section Nine are not only forced to witness traumatic events through the eyes of both victims and murderers, but they also need to negotiate with the victims' families, whose consent is required for the post-mortem MRI scans.\n\nFreshly graduated from the police academy, Ikkou Aoki joins Section Nine to replace Maki's best friend Katsuhiro Suzuki\u2014a former member who passed away under ambiguous circumstances after watching MRI footage from a particularly morbid criminal case. As a stream of seemingly unrelated events creeps closer to the case of Suzuki's death, Section Nine will have to face its greatest challenge to date, threatening its very existence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Top Secret: The Revelation was released on DVD in nine volumes from July 25, 2008, to March 25, 2009.","season":"spring","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"VAP","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/29\/VAP"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/11\/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/39\/Detective"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/40\/Psychological"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":4018,"type":"manga","name":"Top Secret","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/4018\/Top_Secret"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Kokoro Film (\u30b3\u30b3\u30ed\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0)\" by ALvino"],"endings":["\"Kemuri (\u7159)\" by Makichang"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.ntv.co.jp\/secret\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=5658"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=9146"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Himitsu_%E2%80%93_Top_Secret"}],"streaming":[]}}
