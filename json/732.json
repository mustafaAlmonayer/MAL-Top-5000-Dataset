The story focuses on a small hamlet plagued by monster attacks and living under the shadow of rule by Count Magnus Lee, a powerful vampire lord who has ruled the land for thousands of years. When a young girl is bitten by the Count and chosen as his current plaything, she seeks out help of a quiet wandering stranger, D. It so happens that D is one of the world's best vampire hunters, and he takes it upon himself to cut through Magnus Lee's many minions, and put an end to the Count's rule.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/166\/Movic"},{"mal_id":1480,"type":"anime","name":"CBS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1480\/CBS"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/376\/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":242,"type":"anime","name":"Ashi Productions","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/242\/Ashi_Productions"},{"mal_id":1383,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Live","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1383\/Studio_Live"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/14\/Horror"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":32,"type":"anime","name":"Vampire","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/32\/Vampire"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1360,"type":"manga","name":"Vampire Hunter D","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1360\/Vampire_Hunter_D"},{"mal_id":3988,"type":"manga","name":"Vampire Hunter D","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/3988\/Vampire_Hunter_D"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":543,"type":"anime","name":"Vampire Hunter D (2000)","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/543\/Vampire_Hunter_D_2000"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Your Song\" by TM NETWORK"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/vampire-d.com\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=204"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=654"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vampire_Hunter_D_(1985_film)"}],"streaming":[]}}
