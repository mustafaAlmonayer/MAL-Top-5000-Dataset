For the smart and popular Kyouko Hori, it's the fact that she has to do all the housework and care for her little brother, Souta, because of her parents' busy work schedules. For the gentle Izumi Miyamura, whom everybody sees as an otaku, it's his nine hidden piercings and large body tattoo.\n\nSo what happens when they accidentally discover each other's hidden sides? Sharing parts of themselves that they couldn't with anyone else, strong bonds of friendship soon begin to form between Miyamura and Hori, as well as those around them. As their hidden personas start to dissipate, they slowly learn how to open up to others.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":3,"type":"anime","name":"Gonzo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/3\/Gonzo"},{"mal_id":346,"type":"anime","name":"Hoods Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/346\/Hoods_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1997,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Kai","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1997\/Studio_Kai"},{"mal_id":2188,"type":"anime","name":"Marone","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/2188\/Marone"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":36615,"type":"manga","name":"Hori-san to Miyamura-kun","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/36615\/Hori-san_to_Miyamura-kun"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":42897,"type":"anime","name":"Horimiya","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/42897\/Horimiya"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["5: \"Kiseki (\u8ecc\u8de1)\" by Kyouko Hori (Asami Seto)","6: \"Yasashii Uta (\u512a\u3057\u3044\u6b4c)\" by Kyouko Hori (Asami Seto)","1: \"Shirotsumekusa (\u30b7\u30ed\u30c4\u30e1\u30af\u30b5)\" by Kyouko Hori (Asami Seto)","2: \"Ameoto (\u96e8\u97f3)\" by Izumi Miyamura (Yoshitsugu Matsuoka)","3: \"Shiranai Sekai (\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u4e16\u754c)\" by Kyouko Hori (Asami Seto)","4: \"Himawari (\u5411\u65e5\u8475)\" by Izumi Miyamura (Yoshitsugu Matsuoka)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.ganganonline.com\/pop\/horimiyaova\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=9229"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=14297"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hori-san_to_Miyamura-kun#OVA"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E5%A0%80%E3%81%95%E3%82%93%E3%81%A8%E5%AE%AE%E6%9D%91%E3%81%8F%E3%82%93#OVA"},{"name":"Bangumi","url":"https:\/\/bangumi.tv\/subject\/51944"},{"name":"Baidu Baike","url":"https:\/\/baike.baidu.com\/item\/%E5%A0%80%E4%B8%8E%E5%AE%AB%E6%9D%91\/19347290"},{"name":"Baidu Baike","url":"https:\/\/baike.baidu.com\/item\/%E5%A0%80%E6%A1%91%E4%B8%8E%E5%AE%AB%E6%9D%91%E5%90%9B%20OVA5\/57280354"},{"name":"Baidu Baike","url":"https:\/\/baike.baidu.com\/item\/%E5%A0%80%E6%A1%91%E4%B8%8E%E5%AE%AB%E6%9D%91%E5%90%9B%20OVA6\/57280428"},{"name":"Douban","url":"https:\/\/movie.douban.com\/subject\/11577132\/"},{"name":"Douban","url":"https:\/\/movie.douban.com\/subject\/25865840\/"},{"name":"Douban","url":"https:\/\/movie.douban.com\/subject\/26304200\/"},{"name":"Douban","url":"https:\/\/movie.douban.com\/subject\/30453102\/"},{"name":"Douban","url":"https:\/\/movie.douban.com\/subject\/35426255\/"},{"name":"Douban","url":"https:\/\/movie.douban.com\/subject\/35426257\/"}],"streaming":[]}}
