However, Sailor Mars' apocalyptic visions and the appearance of two new guardians\u2014Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus\u2014signal that a new battle will soon begin.\n \nThese newcomers seek three Talismans that are inside the Pure Heart Crystals within human beings. Once brought together, these objects form The Holy Grail, a magical relic with extraordinary abilities. They want to use the Grail to save the world, but an evil organization known as the Death Busters seeks its power for their own desires.\n\nThe removal of a Talisman from a person's Heart Crystal will cause their death, something that Uranus and Neptune see as a necessary sacrifice to form the Grail, while Sailor Moon and her group deem it unforgivable. But can any sacrifice be worth the cost if it saves the lives of the entire human race?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1994,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"TV Asahi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/55\/TV_Asahi"},{"mal_id":2292,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Advertising","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/2292\/Toei_Advertising"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/119\/VIZ_Media"},{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1459\/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/66\/Mahou_Shoujo"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":92,"type":"manga","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/92\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":740,"type":"anime","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/740\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_R"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":997,"type":"anime","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kaguya-hime no Koibito","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/997\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_S__Kaguya-hime_no_Koibito"},{"mal_id":42441,"type":"anime","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kotaete Moon Call!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/42441\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_S__Kotaete_Moon_Call"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1239,"type":"anime","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon SuperS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1239\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_SuperS"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":8756,"type":"anime","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Memorial","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/8756\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_Memorial"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":31733,"type":"anime","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Crystal Season III","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/31733\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_Crystal_Season_III"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Moonlight Densetsu\" by Moon Lips"],"endings":["1: \"Otome no Policy\" by Yoko Ishida (eps 1-2)","2: \"Tuxedo Mirage\" by Peach Hips (eps 3-38)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.toei-anim.co.jp\/lineup\/tv\/sailor_moon_s\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2538"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=80"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sailor_Moon_S"}],"streaming":[]}}
