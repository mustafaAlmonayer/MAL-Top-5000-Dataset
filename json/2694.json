The story is actually based upon real people - the doctor, Ryo-an, was Tezuka's great grandfather.\n\nDuring the Second Year of Ansei (1855) in Edo's Koishigawa are two young men, Manjiro Ibutani and Ryoan Tezuka. Ibutani is a low-ranking samurai who is a gifted swordsman and has a straightforward and strong sense of justice. Tezuka has a more carefree attitude. He has an eye for the ladies, but he is passionate about becoming a doctor. The two opposite characters come of age during the backdrop of the turbulent end of the Tokugawa Period (1600-1868 CE).\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)","background":"Winner of the Excellence Award on the 4th Japan Media Arts Festival.","season":"spring","year":2000,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"00:50","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 00:50 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"VAP","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/29\/VAP"},{"mal_id":1003,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Television Network","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1003\/Nippon_Television_Network"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/11\/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/46\/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"},{"mal_id":67,"type":"anime","name":"Medical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/67\/Medical"},{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Samurai","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/21\/Samurai"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":14689,"type":"manga","name":"Hidamari no Ki","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/14689\/Hidamari_no_Ki"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Hidamari no Ki: Manazashi (Hidamari no Ki~\u307e\u306a\u3056\u3057~)\" by Keiko Matsui"],"endings":["1: \"Hikari no Mukou e (\u5149\u306e\u5411\u3053\u3046\u3078)\" by Charcoal (eps 1-13)","2: \"High Dive\" by Charcoal (eps 14-25)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.madhouse.co.jp\/works\/2000-1999\/works_tv_hidamari.html"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1508"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=2254"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hidamari_no_Ki"}],"streaming":[]}}
