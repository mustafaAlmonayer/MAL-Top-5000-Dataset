Ina-chuu Takkyuu-bu consists of 26 episodes; however, each episode is divided into two 12-minute segments, leading some streaming services to partition the show into 52 episodes. This occurs on the DVD releases as well, although the North American release confused certain two-part episodes, with its episode count at 47. The DVD set consists of five uniquely-named volumes, with certain episodes appearing on their own respective discs.","season":"spring","year":1995,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":80,"type":"anime","name":"Trans Arts","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/80\/Trans_Arts"},{"mal_id":99,"type":"anime","name":"Kitty Films","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/99\/Kitty_Films"},{"mal_id":101,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Hibari","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/101\/Studio_Hibari"},{"mal_id":145,"type":"anime","name":"TBS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/145\/TBS"},{"mal_id":829,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Jack","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/829\/Studio_Jack"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":284,"type":"anime","name":"Central Park Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/284\/Central_Park_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":391,"type":"anime","name":"Grouper Productions","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/391\/Grouper_Productions"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/9\/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":57,"type":"anime","name":"Gag Humor","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/57\/Gag_Humor"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":7577,"type":"manga","name":"Ike!
