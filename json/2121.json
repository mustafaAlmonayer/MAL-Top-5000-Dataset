This time they arrange a world cup with 4 teams: Japan, USA, \"All Europe\", and \"All South America\". In the first match, Japan easily defeats the USA 3:0 and in the second match Europe loses 2:3 against South America. In the final round S.A. shows their \"soccer cyborg\" Carlos Santana, a more than supreme player who seems to be undefeatable. All their classical tricks like Hyugas \"Tiger Shot\" or Tsubasas \"Top Spin\" seem to be totally worthless, but in a hard and spectacular match the Japanese learn more and more to play in unison and finally they get the win.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":390,"type":"anime","name":"Tsuchida Productions","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/390\/Tsuchida_Productions"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/30\/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"Team Sports","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/77\/Team_Sports"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":2116,"type":"anime","name":"Captain Tsubasa","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2116\/Captain_Tsubasa"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":[]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=3561"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=6343"}],"streaming":[]}}
