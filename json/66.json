Accompanying Chiyo are students like Tomo Takino, an energetic tomboy with more enthusiasm than brains; Koyomi Mizuhara, Tomo's best friend whose temper has a fuse shorter than Chiyo; and Sakaki, a tall, athletic beauty whose intimidating looks hide a gentle personality and a painful obsession with cats. In addition, transfer student Ayumu Kasuga, a girl with her head stuck in the clouds, fits right in with the rest of the girls\u2014and she has a few interesting theories about Chiyo's pigtails!\n\nTogether, this lovable group of girls experience the ups and downs of school life, their many adventures filled with constant laughter, surreal absurdity, and occasionally even touching commentary on the bittersweet, temporal nature of high school.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2002,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"01:25","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 01:25 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Genco","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/79\/Genco"},{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/104\/Lantis"},{"mal_id":170,"type":"anime","name":"Imagica","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/170\/Imagica"},{"mal_id":717,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo Music","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/717\/TV_Tokyo_Music"},{"mal_id":745,"type":"anime","name":"Cosmic Ray","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/745\/Cosmic_Ray"},{"mal_id":1344,"type":"anime","name":"King Records","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1344\/King_Records"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/97\/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/376\/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/7\/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"CGDCT","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/52\/CGDCT"},{"mal_id":57,"type":"anime","name":"Gag Humor","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/57\/Gag_Humor"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":85,"type":"manga","name":"Azumanga Daioh","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/85\/Azumanga_Daioh"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":659,"type":"anime","name":"Azumanga Daiou: Gekijou Tanpen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/659\/Azumanga_Daiou__Gekijou_Tanpen"},{"mal_id":1593,"type":"anime","name":"Azumanga Web Daiou","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1593\/Azumanga_Web_Daiou"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Soramimi Cake\" by Oranges & Lemons"],"endings":["\"Raspberry Heaven\" by Oranges & Lemons"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.jcstaff.co.jp\/sakuhin\/nenpyo\/2002\/01_azumanga\/azumanga.htm"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=106"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=799"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Azumanga"}],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https:\/\/www.hidive.com\/tv\/azumanga-daioh"}]}}
