Though she cannot contact him, they made a promise to fulfill their respective dreams: Mitsuki wants to become a professional singer, and Eichi an astronomer. She hopes that one day her music will reach him across the world with a brilliance like that of the full moon.\n\nThere is just one catch: Mitsuki suffers from throat cancer, which makes her voice quiet and singing strenuous. Her grandmother, who has a hatred of music, insists that Mitsuki undergo surgery to remove the cancer, but she refuses due to the risk of losing her voice. One day, two shinigami\u2014Meroko Yui and Takuto Kira\u2014appear to tell her that she only has one year left to live. This sudden revelation spurs Mitsuki into action, and she decides that with Meroko and Takuto's help, she will become a professional singer in the time she has left.\n\nFull Moon wo Sagashite follows the emotional story of Mitsuki and her shinigami friends as they discover what it means to sing\u2014and ultimately, what it means to live.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Full Moon wo Sagashite only follows its manga source for about one episode before going down a different route. VIZ Media had licensed the series, but released only the first 28 episodes on DVD before dropping the title. It was later streamed in its entirety in subbed-only form on Hulu before expiring from the service in August 2013.","season":"spring","year":2002,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"07:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 07:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/139\/Nihon_Ad_Systems"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/119\/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Deen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/37\/Studio_Deen"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/19\/Music"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"manga","name":"Full Moon wo Sagashite","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/8\/Full_Moon_wo_Sagashite"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":1996,"type":"anime","name":"Full Moon wo Sagashite: Kawaii Kawaii Daibouken","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1996\/Full_Moon_wo_Sagashite__Kawaii_Kawaii_Daibouken"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"I \u2665 U\" by THE*SCANTY (eps 1-26)","2: \"Rock'n Roll Princess\" by THE*SCANTY (eps 27-52)"],"endings":["1: \"New Future\" by Changin' My Life (eps 01-06,52)","2: \"My self\" by Changin' My Life (eps 07-26)","3: \"Eternal Snow\" by Changin' My Life (eps 27-42)","4: \"Love Chronicle\" by Changin' My Life (eps 43-51)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.nasinc.co.jp\/jp\/index.php?action=USER.WORKS.DETAIL&master_id=33"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=21"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=872"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Full_Moon_o_Sagashite"}],"streaming":[]}}
