At night, she is often seen at a local Tokyo bar, which has become a safe haven from her stressful job. After a few too many drinks, Tamami begins to feel as if she is invincible, but the hangover afterward begs to differ.\n\nOne such night ends on a disparate note when an intoxicated Tamami hears some familiar chords playing on the record player, bringing tears to her eyes as she recalls bygone years. The melody reminds her of a shy pianist named Rin Kajitani\u2014a boy who was once the closest friend she ever had.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Modern Love Tokyo: Kare ga Kanaderu Futari no Shirabe was released as part of Amazon Studios' Modern Love Tokyo anthology series.
