As they gradually foster a budding friendship, their feelings for one another only become more ambiguous. Growing closer by the day, the two must learn to navigate their contrasting personalities as well as determine the depth of their affection for each other.\n\nThe nature of this relationship gradually shifts when one of them starts to develop feelings beyond the boundaries of a platonic relationship. Even so, Adachi and Shimamura must realize if forming a bond stronger than friendship will bring them closer or tear them apart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2020,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"01:58","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 01:58 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/144\/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1696\/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":200,"type":"anime","name":"Tezuka Productions","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/200\/Tezuka_Productions"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":26,"type":"anime","name":"Girls Love","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/26\/Girls_Love"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":77597,"type":"manga","name":"Adachi to Shimamura","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/77597\/Adachi_to_Shimamura"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":44590,"type":"anime","name":"Adachi to Shimamura Mini Anime","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/44590\/Adachi_to_Shimamura_Mini_Anime"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Kimi ni Aeta Hi (\u541b\u306b\u4f1a\u3048\u305f\u65e5)\" by Adachi (Akari Kitou) & Shimamura (Miku Itou)"],"endings":["\"Kimi no Tonari de (\u30ad\u30df\u306e\u3068\u306a\u308a\u3067)\" by Akari Kitou"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"https:\/\/www.tbs.co.jp\/anime\/adashima\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=14904"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=22954"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adachi_to_Shimamura#Anime"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-282285"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/www.funimation.com\/shows\/adachi-and-shimamura"}]}}
