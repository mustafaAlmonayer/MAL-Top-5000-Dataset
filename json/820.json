Meanwhile, on the other side of the galaxy, Yang\u2014a strong supporter of democratic ideals\u2014has to stand firm in his beliefs, despite the struggles of the FPA, and show his pupil, Julian Mintz, that autocracy is not the solution.\n\nAs ideologies clash amidst the war's many casualties, the two strategic masterminds must ask themselves what the real reason behind their battle is.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Legend of the Galactic Heroes was adapted from a series of ten novels, published 1982\u201387, by Yoshiki Tanaka. The novels won the Seiun Award for the best long-form Japanese science fiction in 1988. At the start of its production the anime was distributed through a subscription system in which episodes were mailed to existing fans of the novels. It was made in four separate tranches over nearly a decade, with the production of side-stories continuing for several further years. The main series has the largest voice cast of any anime, with well over 300 voice actors, and it is the longest OVA series ever made. The novels have also been adapted into a manga, a stage musical by the Takarazuka Revue and a number of games.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":99,"type":"anime","name":"Kitty Films","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/99\/Kitty_Films"},{"mal_id":382,"type":"anime","name":"Tokuma Shoten","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/382\/Tokuma_Shoten"},{"mal_id":1493,"type":"anime","name":"Tokuma Japan Communications","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1493\/Tokuma_Japan_Communications"},{"mal_id":2434,"type":"anime","name":"Wright Staff","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/2434\/Wright_Staff"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/376\/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1269,"type":"anime","name":"K-Factory","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1269\/K-Factory"},{"mal_id":2256,"type":"anime","name":"Kitty Film Mitaka Studio","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/2256\/Kitty_Film_Mitaka_Studio"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/50\/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/38\/Military"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/29\/Space"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":6978,"type":"manga","name":"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/6978\/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu"},{"mal_id":11941,"type":"manga","name":"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/11941\/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":3016,"type":"anime","name":"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu: Arata naru Tatakai no Overture","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3016\/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu__Arata_naru_Tatakai_no_Overture"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":3371,"type":"anime","name":"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu Gaiden","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3371\/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu_Gaiden"},{"mal_id":3665,"type":"anime","name":"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu Gaiden (1999)","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3665\/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu_Gaiden_1999"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":31433,"type":"anime","name":"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu: Die Neue These -
