In addition, due to his untidy appearance and low self-esteem, he is an easy target for bullies. Regardless, any misfortune that falls upon Mikoto is partly his own fault\u2014at least, that is what Yuki Fukuzawa, the most popular girl in class, believes. With this assumption, Yuki invites Mikoto to join the school's bicycle club, in hopes he can improve himself and gain new friends. Motivated by feelings he has for Yuki, Mikoto has no reason to decline her offer\u2014except for the fact that he does not know how to ride a bicycle.\n\nDespite his lack of even the fundamentals, Mikoto cannot get over the image of himself on a bicycle. Eventually, he succumbs to his curiosity and sneaks into the school grounds at night to practice. This begins Mikoto's journey as he pedals his way through the vast world of cycling, where the scenery of his life changes in ways he never thought possible.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"01:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 01:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/64\/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/144\/Pony_Canyon"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Xebec","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/27\/Xebec"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/30\/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":3,"type":"anime","name":"Racing","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/3\/Racing"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":2720,"type":"manga","name":"Over Drive","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/2720\/Over_Drive"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"WINDER ~Boku wa Koko ni Iru~\" by Shonen Kamikaze"],"endings":["1: \"Saihate no Parade\" by Merry (eps 1-13)","2: \"Koi Suzumi\" by DEL (eps 14-26)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.tv-tokyo.co.jp\/anime\/overdrive\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=5072"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=7629"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Over_Drive_%28anime%29"}],"streaming":[]}}
