No man can resist Ono's charms (or his cooking skills!) but he has just found a new position under a man named Tachibana. Can this be the only man who resisted his charms, and if so, will the man who once snubbed the \"magically gay\" Ono get his just deserts? And how in the heck did a former middleweight boxing champion wind up as Ono's cake boy? \n\n(Source: DMP)","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2008,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"00:45","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 00:45 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/53\/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/169\/Fuji_TV"},{"mal_id":517,"type":"anime","name":"Asmik Ace","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/517\/Asmik_Ace"},{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/757\/Sony_Music_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1672,"type":"anime","name":"Shinshokan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1672\/Shinshokan"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":217,"type":"anime","name":"Nozomi Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/217\/Nozomi_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/22\/Nippon_Animation"},{"mal_id":235,"type":"anime","name":"Shirogumi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/235\/Shirogumi"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"Boys Love","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/28\/Boys_Love"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":47,"type":"anime","name":"Gourmet","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/47\/Gourmet"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":209,"type":"manga","name":"Seiyou Kottou Yougashiten","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/209\/Seiyou_Kottou_Yougashiten"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Life goes on ~side K~\" by CHEMISTRY"],"endings":["\"Life goes on ~side D~\" by CHEMISTRY"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.antique-anime.com\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=5971"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=9501"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Antique_Bakery"}],"streaming":[]}}
