In an attempt to spice things up, he decides to visit the roof of the school, and it is there that he sees a mysterious young maiden with pitch-black hair. Unbeknownst to him, her name is Tomoko Kuroki, and she is infamous for her bizarre behavior.\n\nThe conversation that ensues from the meeting leaves a lasting impression on Aomatsu, compelling him to return day after day just to see Tomoko again. Tomoko's view of their meetings, however, is quite different from that of Aomatsu, leading to the two having significantly different memories of a particular event.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"This OVA serves as the 13th episode of the TV anime and was bundled with the special limited first edition of the 7th manga volume.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":300,"type":"anime","name":"SILVER LINK.","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/300\/SILVER_LINK"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":69,"type":"anime","name":"Otaku Culture","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/69\/Otaku_Culture"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":16742,"type":"anime","name":"Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/16742\/Watashi_ga_Motenai_no_wa_Dou_Kangaetemo_Omaera_ga_Warui"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaete mo Omaera ga Warui (\u79c1\u304c\u30e2\u30c6\u306a\u3044\u306e\u306f\u3069\u3046\u8003\u3048\u3066\u3082\u304a\u524d\u3089\u304c\u60aa\u3044)\" by Konomi Suzuki n' Kiba of Akiba"],"endings":["\"Dou Kangaete mo Watashi wa Warukunai (\u3069\u3046\u8003\u3048\u3066\u3082\u79c1\u306f\u60aa\u304f\u306a\u3044)\" by Tomoko Kuroki (Izumi Kitta)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.watamote.jp\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=10064"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/WataMote"}],"streaming":[]}}
