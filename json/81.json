Their reunion weakens his resolve to continue fighting, and now the young commander Shiro must prove his loyalty to the Federation\u2014or be branded a traitor.\n \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"After the death of Director Takeyuki Kanda on July 27, 1996, the release of the remaining six episodes was delayed.
