Glancing at the checkout cards of her books one evening, she notices that her library books are frequently checked out by a boy named Seiji Amasawa. Curiosity strikes Shizuku, and she decides to search for the boy who shares her love for literature.\n\nMeeting a peculiar cat on the train, Shizuku follows the animal and is eventually led to a quaint antique shop, where she learns about a cat statuette known as \"The Baron.\" Taking an interest in the shop, she surprisingly finds Seiji, and the two quickly befriend one another. Shizuku learns while acquainting herself with Seiji that he has a dream that he would like to fulfill, causing her dismay as she remains uncertain of her future and has yet to recognize her talents.\n\nHowever, as her relationship with Seiji grows, Shizuku becomes determined to work toward a goal. Guided by the whispers of her heart and inspiration from The Baron, she resolves to carve out her own potential and dreams.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Mimi wo Sumaseba is the highest-grossing Japanese film of 1995 and the first Japanese film that used the Dolby Digital sound format.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":382,"type":"anime","name":"Tokuma Shoten","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/382\/Tokuma_Shoten"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":417,"type":"anime","name":"Disney Platform Distribution","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/417\/Disney_Platform_Distribution"},{"mal_id":783,"type":"anime","name":"GKIDS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/783\/GKIDS"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Ghibli","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/21\/Studio_Ghibli"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":5228,"type":"manga","name":"Mimi wo Sumaseba","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/5228\/Mimi_wo_Sumaseba"}]},{"relation":"Spin-off","entry":[{"mal_id":597,"type":"anime","name":"Neko no Ongaeshi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/597\/Neko_no_Ongaeshi"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" by Olivia Newton-John"],"endings":["\"Country Road (\u30ab\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9)\" by Youko Honna"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"https:\/\/www.ghibli.jp\/works\/mimi\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=336"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=847"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Whisper_of_the_Heart"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E8%80%B3%E3%82%92%E3%81%99%E3%81%BE%E3%81%9B%E3%81%B0"},{"name":"Syoboi","url":"https:\/\/cal.syoboi.jp\/tid\/3049"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Netflix","url":"https:\/\/www.netflix.com\/"}]}}
