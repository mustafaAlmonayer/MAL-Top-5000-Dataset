Its extravagant lead singer, Johannes Krauser II, is especially infamous as a demonic being who has risen from the fiery pits of hell itself in order to bring the world to its knees and lord over all mortals\u2014or at least that's what he's publicized to be.\n\nUnbeknownst to his many worshippers, Krauser II is just the alter ego of an average college graduate named Souichi Negishi. Although he is soft-spoken, peace-loving, and would rather listen to Swedish pop all day, he must participate in DMC's garish concerts in order to make ends meet. Detroit Metal City chronicles Negishi's hilarious misadventures as he attempts to juggle his hectic band life, a seemingly budding romance, and dealing with his incredibly obsessive and dedicated fans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Detroit Metal City's name originated from the song Detroit Rock City by the band KISS.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/757\/Sony_Music_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1584,"type":"anime","name":"Beyond C.","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1584\/Beyond_C"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/376\/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Studio 4\u00b0C","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/13\/Studio_4%C2%B0C"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":57,"type":"anime","name":"Gag Humor","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/57\/Gag_Humor"},{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/19\/Music"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1735,"type":"manga","name":"Detroit Metal City","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1735\/Detroit_Metal_City"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":5065,"type":"anime","name":"Detroit Metal City: Birth of the Metal Devil","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5065\/Detroit_Metal_City__Birth_of_the_Metal_Devil"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Satsugai\" by Detroit Metal City \/ Soichi Negishi (Yuuji Ueda)"],"endings":["\"Amai Koibito (\u7518\u3044\u604b\u4eba)\" by Hideki Kaji"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.younganimal.com\/dmc_movie\/dmc_moviedetail.html"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=5587"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=10172"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Detroit_Metal_City"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E3%83%87%E3%83%88%E3%83%AD%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88%E3%83%BB%E3%83%A1%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B7%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3"},{"name":"Syoboi","url":"https:\/\/cal.syoboi.jp\/tid\/1572"}],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https:\/\/www.hidive.com\/tv\/detroit-metal-city"}]}}
