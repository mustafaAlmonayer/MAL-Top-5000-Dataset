Iori has high hopes and dreams about having the ideal college experience, but when he enters the shop he is sucked into the alcoholic activities of the carefree members of the Diving Club who frequent the place. Persuaded by upperclassmen Shinji Tokita and Ryuujirou Kotobuki, Iori reluctantly joins their bizarre party. His cousin Chisa Kotegawa later walks in and catches him in the act, earning Iori her utter disdain.\n\nBased on Kenji Inoue and Kimitake Yoshioka's popular comedy manga, Grand Blue follows Iori's misadventures with his eccentric new friends as he strives to realize his ideal college dream, while also learning how to scuba dive.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2018,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"02:55","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 02:55 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/143\/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/159\/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1113,"type":"anime","name":"NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1113\/NBCUniversal_Entertainment_Japan"},{"mal_id":1284,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Pictures","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1284\/Avex_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1287,"type":"anime","name":"Q-Tec","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1287\/Q-Tec"},{"mal_id":1501,"type":"anime","name":"JR East Marketing & Communications","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1501\/JR_East_Marketing___Communications"},{"mal_id":1602,"type":"anime","name":"GYAO!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1602\/GYAO"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1379,"type":"anime","name":"Zero-G","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1379\/Zero-G"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/50\/Adult_Cast"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":70345,"type":"manga","name":"Grand Blue","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/70345\/Grand_Blue"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Grand Blue\" by Shounan no Kaze (eps 1-11)"],"endings":["1: \"Konpeki no Alfine ~Nikenme ni Karaoke ni Haitta Oretachi no Tension Super MAX ver.~ (\u7d3a\u78a7\u306e\u30a2\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30cd \uff5e\u4e8c\u8ed2\u76ee\u306b\u30ab\u30e9\u30aa\u30b1\u306b\u5165\u3063\u305f\u4ffa\u305f\u3061\u306e\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fcMAXver.\uff5e)\" by Izu no Kaze (\u4f0a\u8c46\u4e43\u98a8) [Iori Kitahar","2: \"Konpeki no Alpine ~Kaya Mizuki ver.~\" by Kaya Mizuki (eps 11)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.grandblue-anime.com\/"},{"name":"@gb_anime","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gb_anime"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=13734"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=20709"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Grand_Blue"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E3%81%90%E3%82%89%E3%82%93%E3%81%B6%E3%82%8B#%E3%83%86%E3%83%AC%E3%83%93%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1"},{"name":"Syoboi","url":"https:\/\/cal.syoboi.jp\/tid\/4967"}],"streaming":[]}}
