Now that it is broken, several kingdoms seek to explore the lands that were once beyond their grasp. To this end, they establish a peace delegation to make contact with the inhabitants of the new world.\n\nMeanwhile, the young sorceress Lina Inverse receives a message from a mysterious woman named Filia ul Copt. When they meet, Filia expresses interest in hiring Lina and her friends, having heard of their great deeds, for a certain task that will take them to the outside realm. Despite that, Filia feels the need to put their strength to the test and pits them against a dragon in the middle of the city! After proving themselves, the sorceress and her fellow adventurers set off for the unexplored lands, where many adventures and a worrying prophecy await them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1997,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"18:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 18:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":153,"type":"anime","name":"SoftX","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/153\/SoftX"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"},{"mal_id":284,"type":"anime","name":"Central Park Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/284\/Central_Park_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":154,"type":"anime","name":"E&G Films","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/154\/E_G_Films"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":8876,"type":"manga","name":"Slayers","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/8876\/Slayers"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":535,"type":"anime","name":"Slayers Next","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/535\/Slayers_Next"},{"mal_id":866,"type":"anime","name":"Slayers Premium","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/866\/Slayers_Premium"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":4028,"type":"anime","name":"Slayers Revolution","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/4028\/Slayers_Revolution"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Breeze\" by Megumi Hayashibara"],"endings":["1: \"Don't be Discouraged\" by Megumi Hayashibara (eps 1-25)","2: \"Somewhere\" by Houko Kuwashima (eps 26)"]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=364"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=658"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slayers_Try"}],"streaming":[]}}
