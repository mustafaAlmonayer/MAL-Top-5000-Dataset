When it became co-ed, the girls, out of fear, asked to be permitted to bring weapons to school. When that was enforced, a five-member vigilante corps-like organization called the \"Supreme Five Swords\" was also formed.\n\nAfter many generations, the five swords eventually became a group which corrected problematic students, and the academy started proactively accepting such students in order to correct them.\n\nNomura Fudou was sent to this school after being part of a huge brawl. What will he do when the only options he has after enrolling are being expelled from that school or being corrected the way the rest of the male students there were...by being forced to dress and act like a girl!\n\n(Source: Batoto, edited)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"23:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 23:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":108,"type":"anime","name":"Media Factory","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/108\/Media_Factory"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/238\/AT-X"},{"mal_id":323,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Columbia","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/323\/Nippon_Columbia"},{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/460\/KlockWorx"},{"mal_id":1255,"type":"anime","name":"Glovision","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1255\/Glovision"},{"mal_id":1551,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Media House","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1551\/Kadokawa_Media_House"},{"mal_id":1685,"type":"anime","name":"Toshiba Digital Frontiers","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1685\/Toshiba_Digital_Frontiers"},{"mal_id":1686,"type":"anime","name":"Tsukuru no Mori","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1686\/Tsukuru_no_Mori"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1696\/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/376\/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":300,"type":"anime","name":"SILVER LINK.","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/300\/SILVER_LINK"},{"mal_id":957,"type":"anime","name":"Connect","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/957\/Connect"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/9\/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/35\/Harem"},{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/17\/Martial_Arts"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":81707,"type":"manga","name":"Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/81707\/Busou_Shoujo_Machiavellianism"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":35314,"type":"anime","name":"Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism: Doki! \"Goken-darake\" no Ian Ryokou","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/35314\/Busou_Shoujo_Machiavellianism__Doki_Goken-darake_no_Ian_Ryokou"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Shocking Blue\" by Miku Itou"],"endings":["\"DECIDE\" by Tenga Goken [Rin Onigawara (Yuuki Takada), Mary Kikakujou (Sayaka Kitahara), Satori Tamada (Nozomi Nishida), Warabi Hanasaka (Rina Hidaka), Tsukuyo Inaba (Natsumi Hioka)]"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/machiavellism-anime.jp\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=12230"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=18970"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E6%AD%A6%E8%A3%85%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3%E3%83%9E%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A7%E3%83%AA%E3%82%BA%E3%83%A0"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-280226"},{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https:\/\/www.hidive.com\/tv\/armed-girls-machiavellism"}]}}
