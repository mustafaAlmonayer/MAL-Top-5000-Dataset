It involved the adventures of three agents from outer space who were sent to Earth to determine whether the planet, a potential threat to the universe, should be destroyed. The instrument of destruction is a device resembling a large black ball with two antennae that is variously called an anti-proton bomb, a solar bomb, and a neutron bomb. Although the three agents (Captain Bokko, Nokko, and Pukko) are originally humanoid in appearance, upon arrival on Earth they take on the appearances of a rabbit (Bokko), a horse (Nokko), and a duck (Pukko) that they had captured as examples of Earth life forms. While on Earth they travel in a tire-shaped vehicle capable of enormous speeds called the Big Wheel, which can travel on both land and water (and, with modifications, through the air).\n\nThe series tackles a number of issues which were surprisingly progressive for an animated cartoon of that period; particularly ecological concerns and poverty.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","background":null,"season":"summer","year":1965,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/169\/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":68,"type":"anime","name":"Mushi Production","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/68\/Mushi_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":22300,"type":"manga","name":"Wonder 3","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/22300\/Wonder_3"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":30767,"type":"anime","name":"Wonder 3 Pilot","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/30767\/Wonder_3_Pilot"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Wonder 3 (\u30ef\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc3)\" by \u5c0f\u5cf6\u5eb7\u7537, Vocal Shop, Shinsuke Chikaishi, Fuyumi Shiraishi"],"endings":["\"Wonder 3 (Instrumental version)\" by Seiichirou Uno (\u5b87\u91ce\u8aa0\u4e00\u90ce)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/en.tezuka.co.jp\/anime\/sakuhin\/ts\/ts004.html"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2876"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=626"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wonder_Three"}],"streaming":[]}}
