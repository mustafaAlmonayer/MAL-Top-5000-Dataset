When Matsuda overhears the orchestra members praising Shinichi Chiaki, the budding Japanese conductor of the Roux-Marlet Orchestra, he can barely contain his contempt at there being another \"Black-Haired Noble\" in the same city. Freshly dumped by his mistress following the performance, Matsuda catches Chiaki and takes him out to drink under the pretense of discussing career. But much to Chiaki's chagrin, the subject soon turns to Chiaki's own special someone.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/7\/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/50\/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/19\/Music"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":43,"type":"anime","name":"Josei","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/43\/Josei"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":4477,"type":"anime","name":"Nodame Cantabile: Paris-hen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/4477\/Nodame_Cantabile__Paris-hen"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"\u6771\u4eac et \u5df4\u91cc (Tokyo and Paris)\" by Emiri Miyamoto x Solita"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.nodame-anime.com\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=6779"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nodame_Cantabile#Anime"}],"streaming":[]}}
