Fortunately, Ushio knows it's best to let sleeping dogs lie and leave captured demons where they are. Unfortunately, the release of the monster's evil energies begins to beckon other demons to Ushio's hometown! To save his friends and family from the invading spirits, Ushio is forced to release Tora from his captivity. But will the cure prove to be worse than the curse? Will Ushio end his life a Tora-snack? Or will the Beast Spear keep Tora in line long enough to save the city?\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":67,"type":"anime","name":"OB Planning","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/67\/OB_Planning"},{"mal_id":224,"type":"anime","name":"Toshiba EMI","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/224\/Toshiba_EMI"},{"mal_id":245,"type":"anime","name":"TOHO","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/245\/TOHO"},{"mal_id":1430,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1430\/Shogakukan"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/97\/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":413,"type":"anime","name":"Pastel","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/413\/Pastel"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/14\/Horror"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/6\/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":7747,"type":"manga","name":"Ushio to Tora","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/7747\/Ushio_to_Tora"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":5308,"type":"anime","name":"Ushio to Tora: Comical Deformer Gekijou","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5308\/Ushio_to_Tora__Comical_Deformer_Gekijou"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":29854,"type":"anime","name":"Ushio to Tora (TV)","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/29854\/Ushio_to_Tora_TV"},{"mal_id":31098,"type":"anime","name":"Ushio to Tora (TV) 2nd Season","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/31098\/Ushio_to_Tora_TV_2nd_Season"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Yuuki no Fighter (\u52c7\u6c17\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc)\" by Yasu (eps 1-6)","2: \"Kemono no Yari (\u7363\u306e\u69cd)\" by Shinya Iguchi (eps 7-10)"],"endings":["1: \"Dear My Best Friend\" by Nozomu Sasaki (eps 1-6)","2: \"Dareka ga Omae wo Neratteru (\u8ab0\u304b\u304c\u304a\u307e\u3048\u3092\u72d9\u3063\u3066\u308b)\" by Nozomu Sasaki (eps 7-10)"]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1360"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=237"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ushio_and_Tora"}],"streaming":[]}}
