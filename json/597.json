One day, she saves Prince Lune of the Cat Kingdom from being run over by a truck. As a token of gratitude, the Cat King sends her \"presents\" and invites her to the Cat Kingdom to become Lune's wife. Haru's inability to properly communicate with the cats leads to the misunderstanding that she has accepted the proposal.\n\nAs Haru ponders on ways to escape the predicament, a mysterious voice instructs her to search for the Cat Bureau. However, not long after she finally arrives at the bureau, a horde of cats swarms in and forcibly takes her to the Cat Kingdom, along with a member of the Cat Bureau. Concerned for their safety, owner of the Cat Bureau, Baron Humbert von Gikkingen, follows close behind.\n\nThe more Haru immerses herself in the activities of the Cat Kingdom, the more cat-like she becomes. To her dismay, she soon learns that, unless she can find her true self, she may become a cat permanently. Haru's adventures in the world of cats lead her down a path to self-discovery, allowing her to return as a more confident person.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The Cat Returns is a spin-off of the movie Whisper of the Heart, and although some characters are crossed over, the stories in the two films are not related. Studio Ghibli began work on the movie as the 20 minute \"Cat Project\" in 1999 for a theme park in Japan. Although the theme park canceled the project, the 20 minute short film turned into a 45 minute project, and then a feature length film. The movie was the second Studio Ghibli film to be directed by someone other than Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata. It won an Excellence Prize at the 2002 Japan Media Arts Festival. It also won the Feature Film Award in the 7th Animation Kobe Awards in 2002.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":417,"type":"anime","name":"Disney Platform Distribution","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/417\/Disney_Platform_Distribution"},{"mal_id":783,"type":"anime","name":"GKIDS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/783\/GKIDS"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Ghibli","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/21\/Studio_Ghibli"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/46\/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":51,"type":"anime","name":"Anthropomorphic","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/51\/Anthropomorphic"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1372,"type":"manga","name":"Baron: Neko no Danshaku","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1372\/Baron__Neko_no_Danshaku"}]},{"relation":"Parent story","entry":[{"mal_id":585,"type":"anime","name":"Mimi wo Sumaseba","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/585\/Mimi_wo_Sumaseba"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Kaze ni naru\" by Ayano Tsuji"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"https:\/\/www.ghibli.jp\/works\/baron\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=679"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=868"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Cat_Returns"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Netflix","url":"https:\/\/www.netflix.com\/"}]}}
