She aspires to an average lifestyle as a delicate young lady with a handsome boyfriend in the near future.\n\nUnfortunately for Yawara, she has an undesirable prodigious talent in Judo, a modern martial art that is neither feminine nor fashionable. Moreover, Yawara is the only granddaughter of the seventh dan Judo master Jigorou Inokuma, who expects her to become a Japanese Judoka superstar of the '90s.\n\nYawara cautiously hides her strength from everyone to maintain a normal reputation but is often pushed to situations when she must exercise her Judo skills. Observing Yawara's immense potential from the shadows, Kousaku Matsuda, a sports reporter from a substandard paper, is willing to do everything he can to bring her into the limelight.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Yawara! competed against Ranma \u00bd on Japanese television and achieved higher ratings, although Ranma \u00bd was more popular internationally. Yawara! had remained quite unknown outside Japan and only got licensed for North American distribution in August 2006, over a decade after its airing period.","season":"fall","year":1989,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"07:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 07:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":99,"type":"anime","name":"Kitty Films","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/99\/Kitty_Films"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":310,"type":"anime","name":"AnimEigo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/310\/AnimEigo"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/11\/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"},{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/30\/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":54,"type":"anime","name":"Combat Sports","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/54\/Combat_Sports"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":853,"type":"manga","name":"Yawara!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/853\/Yawara"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":2008,"type":"anime","name":"Yawara!
