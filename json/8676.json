Since then, he has had a hard time showing others his true feelings in fear of being rejected again. However, as luck would have it, Junichi may have a second chance at love when he meets several girls whom he becomes romantically interested in: Haruka Morishima, the energetic and popular upperclassman with a love for cute things; Kaoru Tanamachi, his childhood friend who harbors secret feelings for him; Sae Nakata, the timid transfer student who is shy around men; Ai Nanasaki, a girl on the swim team who has a bad first impression of Junichi; Rihoko Sakurai, a childhood friend with a love for sweets; and Tsukasa Ayatsuji, a seemingly perfect class representative who has a hidden dark side. As Christmas Eve approaches, Junichi can only hope that this will be the year he will finally spend the holidays with the one he truly loves.\n \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2010,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/144\/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":145,"type":"anime","name":"TBS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/145\/TBS"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/166\/Movic"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/376\/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"AIC","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/48\/AIC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/35\/Harem"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":17607,"type":"manga","name":"Amagami: Precious Diary","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/17607\/Amagami__Precious_Diary"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":9117,"type":"anime","name":"Amagami SS OVA","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/9117\/Amagami_SS_OVA"},{"mal_id":9925,"type":"anime","name":"Amagami SS: Tachibana Miya-hen - Imouto","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/9925\/Amagami_SS__Tachibana_Miya-hen_-_Imouto"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":11235,"type":"anime","name":"Amagami SS+ Plus","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/11235\/Amagami_SS__Plus"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":33836,"type":"anime","name":"Seiren","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/33836\/Seiren"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"i Love\" by azusa (eps 1-12)","2: \"Kimi no Mama de (\u541b\u306e\u307e\u307e\u3067)\" by azusa (eps 13-25)"],"endings":["1: \"Kimi no Hitomi ni Koishiteru (\u30ad\u30df\u306e\u77b3\u306b\u604b\u3057\u3066\u308b)\" by Shizuka Itou (eps 1-4)","2: \"Kitto Ashita wa (\u304d\u3063\u3068\u660e\u65e5\u306f\u2026)\" by Rina Satou (eps 5-8)","3: \"Anata Shika Mienai (\u3042\u306a\u305f\u3057\u304b\u898b\u3048\u306a\u3044)\" by Hiromi Konno (eps 9-12)","4: \"Koi wa Mizu-iro (\u604b\u306f\u307f\u305a\u3044\u308d)\" by Yukana (eps 13-16)","5: \"Koi wa Aserazu (\u604b\u306f\u3042\u305b\u3089\u305a)\" by Ryouko Shintani (eps 17-20)","6: \"Nageki no Tenshi (\u5606\u304d\u306e\u5929\u4f7f)\" by Kaori Nazuka (eps 21-24)","7: \"Koi no Yukue (\u604b\u306e\u3086\u304f\u3048)\" by Mai Kadowaki (eps 25)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.tbs.co.jp\/anime\/amagami\/1st\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=7506"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=11474"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Amagami"}],"streaming":[{"name":"HIDIVE","url":"https:\/\/www.hidive.com\/tv\/amagami-ss"}]}}
