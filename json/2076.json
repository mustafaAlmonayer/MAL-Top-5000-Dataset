Hajime is the grandson of the man who was once Japan's greatest detective, and he is also a remarkable sleuth himself.\n\nWith the help of his best friend, Miyuki Nanase, and the peculiar inspector Isamu Kenmochi, Hajime travels to remote islands, ominous towns, abysmal seas, and other hostile environments. His life's mission is to uncover the truth behind some of the most cunning, grueling, and disturbing mysteries the world has ever faced.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":1997,"broadcast":{"day":"Mondays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Mondays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/53\/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":76,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri Telecasting","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/76\/Yomiuri_Telecasting"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":393,"type":"manga","name":"Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo: File Series","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/393\/Kindaichi_Shounen_no_Jikenbo__File_Series"},{"mal_id":17111,"type":"manga","name":"Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo - Short File Series","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/17111\/Kindaichi_Shounen_no_Jikenbo_-_Short_File_Series"},{"mal_id":17149,"type":"manga","name":"Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo: Case Series","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/17149\/Kindaichi_Shounen_no_Jikenbo__Case_Series"},{"mal_id":114862,"type":"manga","name":"Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/114862\/Kindaichi_Shounen_no_Jikenbo"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":2077,"type":"anime","name":"Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo Movie 1: Operazakan - Aratanaru Satsujin","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2077\/Kindaichi_Shounen_no_Jikenbo_Movie_1__Operazakan_-_Aratanaru_Satsujin"},{"mal_id":3245,"type":"anime","name":"Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo Specials","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3245\/Kindaichi_Shounen_no_Jikenbo_Specials"},{"mal_id":15819,"type":"anime","name":"Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo: Kuromajutsu Satsujin Jiken-hen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/15819\/Kindaichi_Shounen_no_Jikenbo__Kuromajutsu_Satsujin_Jiken-hen"},{"mal_id":21701,"type":"anime","name":"Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo: Shinigami Byouin Satsujin Jiken","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/21701\/Kindaichi_Shounen_no_Jikenbo__Shinigami_Byouin_Satsujin_Jiken"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":9154,"type":"anime","name":"Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo Movie 2: Satsuriku no Deep Blue","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/9154\/Kindaichi_Shounen_no_Jikenbo_Movie_2__Satsuriku_no_Deep_Blue"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":22817,"type":"anime","name":"Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo Returns","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/22817\/Kindaichi_Shounen_no_Jikenbo_Returns"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":29821,"type":"anime","name":"Channel 5.5","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/29821\/Channel_55"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Confused Memories\" by Yuko Tsuburaya (eps 1-23)","2: \"meet again\" by Laputa (eps 24-42)","3: \"\u541b\u304c\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3089\u2025 (Kimi ga iru kara..)\" by Yui Nishiwaki (eps 43-69)","4: \"Brave\" by Grass Arcade (eps 70-83)","5: \"Justice\" by Miru Takayama with TWO-MIX (eps 84-105)","6: \"Why?
