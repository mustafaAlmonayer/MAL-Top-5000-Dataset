The first episode, \"The Scary Chimera Plan,\" pits them against a lunatic magician who intends to use Lina to create a fearsome, spell-slinging monster. Then, in \"Jeffry's Knighthood,\" they're hired by an overprotective mother to see that her son - a young man barely capable of holding a sword - becomes a respected knight, by \"helping\" him fight off the marauding soldiers terrorizing the area. Finally, \"Mirror, Mirror\" puts the two in a race to hunt down and capture (for bounty, of course) a rogue sorceror who's found an ancient artifact that can create loyal duplicates of anything or anyone, including his enemies. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/113\/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":165,"type":"anime","name":"Marubeni","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/165\/Marubeni"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/97\/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/7\/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":719,"type":"manga","name":"Slayers Special","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/719\/Slayers_Special"},{"mal_id":20869,"type":"manga","name":"Slayers Special","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/20869\/Slayers_Special"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":534,"type":"anime","name":"Slayers","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/534\/Slayers"},{"mal_id":536,"type":"anime","name":"Slayers: The Motion Picture","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/536\/Slayers__The_Motion_Picture"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1171,"type":"anime","name":"Slayers Excellent","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1171\/Slayers_Excellent"}]}],"theme":{"openings":[],"endings":["\"Kagirinai Yokubou no Naka ni\" by Megumi Hayashibara"]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=155"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=736"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_Slayers_media"}],"streaming":[]}}
