Upon realizing that Kaguya is behind the troubling events and that she holds a terrible power, they join forces once more to stop the disastrous fate she has planned for the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"InuYasha Movie 2: Kagami no Naka no Mugenjou premiered between the release of the TV series' episodes 95 and 96.
