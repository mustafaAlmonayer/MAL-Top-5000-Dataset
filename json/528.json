Named Mewtwo, the man-made Pok\u00e9mon quickly becomes upset with the circumstances of its creation and goes on a rampage. It is soon approached by Sakaki, the leader of Team Rocket, and is manipulated into committing evil acts.\n\nRepulsed by the tricks of mankind and the cruelties it has suffered, Mewtwo isolates itself from everyone and plots against humans whilst trying to discover its true purpose in life. Disguising as the world's strongest Pok\u00e9mon trainer, Mewtwo draws in the region's most powerful trainers who want to fight the new, mysterious opponent. With the fate of the world at stake, renowned trainers Satoshi, Takeshi, and Kasumi must battle against Mewtwo and defeat it before it brings about the downfall of humanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The Origin of Mewtwo was originally not included with the theater release but every subsequent release has included it, so this entry includes it as well in its runtime.
