A series of unfortunate events motivate Hayate to create the elite unit Riot Force 6, which handles cases involving public safety as well as dangerous magical objects known as Lost Logia. There the trio works alongside promising recruits Subaru Nakajima, Teana Lanster, Caro Ru Lushe, and Erio Mondial, who endure difficult training to fulfill expectations while overcoming hurdles and achieving personal goals.\n\nHowever, carrying out their mission proves to be a constant struggle. Battling foes who exploit the Lost Logia and facing criticisms from within the Bureau, Riot Force 6 quickly finds itself stretched thin.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Universal Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/31\/Geneon_Universal_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":171,"type":"anime","name":"A-Line","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/171\/A-Line"},{"mal_id":1344,"type":"anime","name":"King Records","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1344\/King_Records"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Seven Arcs","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/35\/Seven_Arcs"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":66,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/66\/Mahou_Shoujo"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1231,"type":"manga","name":"Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS THE COMICS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1231\/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_StrikerS_THE_COMICS"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":77,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/77\/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_As"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":25939,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViVid","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/25939\/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_ViVid"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":37933,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's Picture Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/37933\/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_As_Picture_Drama"},{"mal_id":37934,"type":"anime","name":"Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS Picture Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/37934\/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_StrikerS_Picture_Drama"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"SECRET AMBITION\" by Nana Mizuki (eps 1-17)","2: \"MASSIVE WONDERS\" by Nana Mizuki (eps 18-26)"],"endings":["1: \"Hoshizora no Spica\" by Yukari Tamura","2: \"Beautiful Amulet\" by Yukari Tamura"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.nanoha.com\/archive3\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4688"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=6828"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_StrikerS"}],"streaming":[]}}
