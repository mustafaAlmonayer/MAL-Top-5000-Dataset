Though it only lasts for five seconds at a time, Yuu's mysterious power allowed him to cheat his way to the top of his class and  enter a prestigious high school, where he continues his dishonest acts.\n\nHis shenanigans are eventually stopped by Nao Tomori\u2014the headstrong student council president from Hoshinoumi Academy\u2014who sees through his deceit. Through coercion, Nao convinces Yuu to transfer to Hoshinoumi and join the student council. Hoshinoumi Academy is secretly an institution created for adolescents who possess supernatural abilities\u2014with the student council serving as a means of locating those who abuse their powers.\n\nWith Yuu begrudgingly assisting in council affairs, the group sets out to find and protect new ability users from harm. However, as they further investigate the abilities, their findings entangle them in far more complicated matters than they could ever imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2015,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/17\/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/143\/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/166\/Movic"},{"mal_id":203,"type":"anime","name":"Visual Arts","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/203\/Visual_Arts"},{"mal_id":681,"type":"anime","name":"ASCII Media Works","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/681\/ASCII_Media_Works"},{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Tokyo MX","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1211\/Tokyo_MX"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1416\/BS11"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/493\/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":132,"type":"anime","name":"P.A.
