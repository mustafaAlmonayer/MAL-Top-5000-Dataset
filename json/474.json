AI is near perfection and the current top idol is the near-completed Virturoid Idol Sharon Apple. All that is missing are her actual feelings, which instead are supplied by Myung Fang Lone. Sharon's debut concert is on planet Eden, where at the same time, fighter pilots Isamu Dyson and Guld Bowman battle over air superiority for the \"Supernova Project.\" Isamu, Guld and Myung were once childhood friends, but after an accident seven years ago, they went their own separate ways. With Myung back in the picture, the old disputes are once again awakened. And when an unstable and illegal AI technique is installed in Sharon, the situation is worsened. \n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/23\/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/62\/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/143\/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":199,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Nue","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/199\/Studio_Nue"},{"mal_id":351,"type":"anime","name":"Big West","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/351\/Big_West"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":947,"type":"anime","name":"Manga Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/947\/Manga_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":110,"type":"anime","name":"Triangle Staff","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/110\/Triangle_Staff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/50\/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/38\/Military"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/29\/Space"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1088,"type":"anime","name":"Macross","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1088\/Macross"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":1211,"type":"anime","name":"Macross Plus Movie Edition","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1211\/Macross_Plus_Movie_Edition"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1397,"type":"anime","name":"Macross 7","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1397\/Macross_7"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Voices (English Version)\" by Michelle Flynn (eps 1)","2: \"Idol Talk\" by Akino Arai (eps 2)","3: \"Pulse\" by Wu Yun Ta Na (eps 4)"],"endings":["1: \"After, in the Dark\" by Mai Yamane (eps 1-3)","2: \"Voices (English Version)\" by Michelle Flynn (eps 4)","2: \"Voices\" by Akino Arai (eps 4)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.macross.co.jp\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=67"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=501"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Macross_Plus"}],"streaming":[]}}
