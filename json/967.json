During his journey, Kenshirou makes use of his deadly fighting form, Hokuto Shinken, to defend the helpless from bloodthirsty ravagers. It isn't long before his exploits begin to attract the attention of greater enemies, like warlords and rival martial artists, and Kenshirou finds himself involved with more than he originally bargained for.\n\nFaced with ever-increasing odds, the successor of Hokuto Shinken is forced to put his skills to the test in an effort to take back what he cares for most. And as these new challenges present themselves and the battle against injustice intensifies, namely his conflict with Shin and the rest of the Nanto Seiken school of martial arts, Kenshirou is gradually transformed into the savior of an irradiated and violent world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Hokuto no Ken covers chapters 1 to 136 of the manga of the same name.","season":"fall","year":1984,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"19:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 19:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/169\/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/467\/Discotek_Media"},{"mal_id":947,"type":"anime","name":"Manga Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/947\/Manga_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/58\/Gore"},{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/17\/Martial_Arts"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/31\/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":1149,"type":"manga","name":"Hokuto no Ken","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1149\/Hokuto_no_Ken"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1356,"type":"anime","name":"Hokuto no Ken 2","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1356\/Hokuto_no_Ken_2"}]},{"relation":"Spin-off","entry":[{"mal_id":1357,"type":"anime","name":"Shin Hokuto no Ken","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1357\/Shin_Hokuto_no_Ken"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":1358,"type":"anime","name":"Hokuto no Ken Movie","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1358\/Hokuto_no_Ken_Movie"},{"mal_id":1773,"type":"anime","name":"Hokuto no Ken: Raoh Gaiden Junai-hen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1773\/Hokuto_no_Ken__Raoh_Gaiden_Junai-hen"},{"mal_id":2174,"type":"anime","name":"Hokuto no Ken: Raoh Gaiden Gekitou-hen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2174\/Hokuto_no_Ken__Raoh_Gaiden_Gekitou-hen"},{"mal_id":3027,"type":"anime","name":"Hokuto no Ken: Yuria-den","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/3027\/Hokuto_no_Ken__Yuria-den"},{"mal_id":4312,"type":"anime","name":"Hokuto no Ken: Toki-den","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/4312\/Hokuto_no_Ken__Toki-den"},{"mal_id":5291,"type":"anime","name":"Hokuto no Ken Zero: Kenshirou Den","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5291\/Hokuto_no_Ken_Zero__Kenshirou_Den"},{"mal_id":10177,"type":"anime","name":"DD Hokuto no Ken","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/10177\/DD_Hokuto_no_Ken"},{"mal_id":56646,"type":"anime","name":"Hokuto no Ken: Fist of the North Star","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/56646\/Hokuto_no_Ken__Fist_of_the_North_Star"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":4549,"type":"anime","name":"Hokuto no Ken: Raoh Gaiden Ten no Haoh","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/4549\/Hokuto_no_Ken__Raoh_Gaiden_Ten_no_Haoh"}]},{"relation":"Other","entry":[{"mal_id":7363,"type":"anime","name":"Hokuto no Ken: Legend of Heroes","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/7363\/Hokuto_no_Ken__Legend_of_Heroes"},{"mal_id":31018,"type":"anime","name":"DD Hokuto no Ken 2 Ichigo Aji+","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/31018\/DD_Hokuto_no_Ken_2_Ichigo_Aji_"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":37388,"type":"anime","name":"Souten no Ken: Regenesis 2nd Season","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/37388\/Souten_no_Ken__Regenesis_2nd_Season"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Ai wo Torimodose!!
