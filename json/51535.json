Though once bitter foes, Armin Arlert, Mikasa Ackerman, and the remaining members of the Scout Regiment join forces with Reiner Braun and the survivors of the Marleyan military. Their meager united front sets out on a mission to stop Eren's wrath and\u2014if possible\u2014save their old comrade in the process.\n\nAs Eren pushes forward at any cost, he battles his own internal turmoil. Although he feels immense remorse over his horrific invasion, Eren believes he harbors noble intentions: he believes the path ahead is the only way to save his friends and, to a greater extent, his people.\n\nThe opposing battalions spiral toward an inevitable final clash that may claim the lives of millions. Though they face an army of monsters beyond anything they could have previously imagined, Mikasa, Armin, and their allies stand brave in the face of certain doom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season - Kanketsu-hen adapts content from volumes 32-34 of the original manga.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/10\/Production_IG"},{"mal_id":53,"type":"anime","name":"Dentsu","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/53\/Dentsu"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/143\/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/144\/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/159\/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1557,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon Enterprises","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1557\/Pony_Canyon_Enterprises"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":569,"type":"anime","name":"MAPPA","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/569\/MAPPA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/41\/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Gore","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/58\/Gore"},{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/38\/Military"},{"mal_id":76,"type":"anime","name":"Survival","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/76\/Survival"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":23390,"type":"manga","name":"Shingeki no Kyojin","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/23390\/Shingeki_no_Kyojin"}]},{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":48583,"type":"anime","name":"Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season Part 2","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/48583\/Shingeki_no_Kyojin__The_Final_Season_Part_2"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Saigo no Kyojin (\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u5de8\u4eba)\" by Linked Horizon (Single episodes version: eps 1-7)"],"endings":["1: \"UNDER THE TREE\" by SiM (eps 1)","2: \"Nisen-nen...
