Even though there are some things that can't be captured with a pencil and paper, she still brings her sketchbook wherever she goes. Her love of drawing eventually leads her to join her school's art club, despite her shy and childish personality.\n\nJust like herself, all of Sora's fellow art club members have their own vivid imagination and personality to match. Through her interactions with the rest of the club, Sora begins to break out of her shell and see more of the world around her, taking every opportunity to sketch whatever is on her mind or in her heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"02:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 02:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":108,"type":"anime","name":"Media Factory","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/108\/Media_Factory"},{"mal_id":109,"type":"anime","name":"Shochiku","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/109\/Shochiku"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/238\/AT-X"},{"mal_id":717,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo Music","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/717\/TV_Tokyo_Music"},{"mal_id":1451,"type":"anime","name":"TYO","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1451\/TYO"},{"mal_id":1452,"type":"anime","name":"Mag Garden","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1452\/Mag_Garden"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":217,"type":"anime","name":"Nozomi Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/217\/Nozomi_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":34,"type":"anime","name":"Hal Film Maker","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/34\/Hal_Film_Maker"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"CGDCT","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/52\/CGDCT"},{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/63\/Iyashikei"},{"mal_id":80,"type":"anime","name":"Visual Arts","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/80\/Visual_Arts"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":4576,"type":"manga","name":"Sketchbook","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/4576\/Sketchbook"},{"mal_id":11264,"type":"manga","name":"Sketchbook: Shucchouban","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/11264\/Sketchbook__Shucchouban"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":6251,"type":"anime","name":"Sketchbook: Full Color's Picture Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/6251\/Sketchbook__Full_Colors_Picture_Drama"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["1: \"Kaze Sagashi (\u98a8\u3055\u304c\u3057)\" by Natsumi Kiyoura (eps 01-11, 13)","2: \"Natsu no Kioku (\u590f\u306e\u8a18\u61b6)\" by Natsumi Kiyoura (eps 12)"],"endings":["1: \"Sketchbook o Motta mama (\u30b9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c1\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u6301\u3063\u305f\u307e\u307e)\" by Yui Makino  (eps 01-12)","2: \"Tanpopo Suisha \uff08\u305f\u3093\u307d\u307d\u6c34\u8eca\uff09\" by Asuka Nakase, Kana Hanazawa, and Yui Makino (eps 13)"]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=5186"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=8031"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sketchbook_(manga)"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-270217"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/www.funimation.com\/shows\/sketchbook-full-colors"}]}}
