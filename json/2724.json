Daicon III Opening Animation The 1981 Daicon III Opening Animation was solely animated by the three-person studio Daicon Film\u2014consisting of university students Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Yamaga, and Takami Akai. While others were involved in the short's production, there were only three members credited. Daicon IV Opening Animation The animation's unauthorized use of the Electric Light Orchestra song \"Twilight\" prevented it from receiving an official release; however, unofficial laserdiscs were produced to pay off the debt of the production. The production of the 1983 Daicon IV Opening Animation was said to be rigorous, and its completion was on the day of its premier. Nevertheless, the short's reception was overwhelmingly positive and spawned it a favorable legacy. A 2001 edition of the Animage magazine ranks both shorts at number 35 in its Top 100 anime productions ranking. The twelve individuals involved with the production of Daicon IV would go on to found the studio Gainax, responsible for the acclaimed anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion. Brief moments of Daicon IV can be seen in Gainax's anime Otaku no Video, which is based around the formation of the studio.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Gainax","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/6\/Gainax"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"},{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/19\/Music"},{"mal_id":69,"type":"anime","name":"Otaku Culture","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/69\/Otaku_Culture"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":["\"Twilight\" by Electric Light Orchestra"],"endings":[]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.gainax.co.jp\/anime\/daicon\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2780"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=817"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Daicon_IV"}],"streaming":[]}}
