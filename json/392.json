His ultimate sacrifice is so out of character that the authorities of the spirit realm are not yet prepared to let him pass on. Koenma, heir to the throne of the spirit realm, offers Yuusuke an opportunity to regain his life through completion of a series of tasks. With the guidance of the death god Botan, he is to thwart evil presences on Earth as a Spirit Detective.\n\nTo help him on his venture, Yuusuke enlists ex-rival Kazuma Kuwabara, and two demons, Hiei and Kurama, who have criminal pasts. Together, they train and battle against enemies who would threaten humanity's very existence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho was voted as the second best anime of the year in 1993 and best anime of the year in 1994 and 1995 at the Animage Anime Grand Prix.","season":"fall","year":1992,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":127,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiko Advertising","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/127\/Yomiko_Advertising"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/169\/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1\/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/17\/Martial_Arts"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/6\/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":53,"type":"manga","name":"Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/53\/Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho"}]},{"relation":"Side story","entry":[{"mal_id":882,"type":"anime","name":"Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho (Movie)","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/882\/Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho_Movie"},{"mal_id":883,"type":"anime","name":"Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho: Meikai Shitou-hen - Honoo no Kizuna","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/883\/Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho__Meikai_Shitou-hen_-_Honoo_no_Kizuna"},{"mal_id":12455,"type":"anime","name":"Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho: Mu Mu Hakusho - Nightmare Hakusho","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/12455\/Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho__Mu_Mu_Hakusho_-_Nightmare_Hakusho"},{"mal_id":36951,"type":"anime","name":"Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho: Two Shots\/Noru ka Soru ka","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/36951\/Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho__Two_Shots_Noru_ka_Soru_ka"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":2125,"type":"anime","name":"Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho: Eizou Hakusho - Ankoku Bujutsukai no Shou","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2125\/Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho__Eizou_Hakusho_-_Ankoku_Bujutsukai_no_Shou"},{"mal_id":2126,"type":"anime","name":"Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho: Eizou Hakusho II","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2126\/Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho__Eizou_Hakusho_II"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":6964,"type":"anime","name":"Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho Picture Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/6964\/Yuu\u2606Yuu\u2606Hakusho_Picture_Drama"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Hohoemi no Bakudan\" by Matsuko Mawatari"],"endings":["1: \"Homework ga Owaranai\" by Matsuko Mawatari (eps 1-29)","2: \"Sayonara bye bye\" by Matsuko Mawatari (eps 30-59)","3: \"Unbalance na Kiss wo Shite\" by Hiro Takahashi (eps 60-83)","4: \"Taiyou ga Mata Kagayaku Toki\" by Hiro Takahashi (eps 84-102)","5: \"Daydream Generation\" by Matsuko Mawatari (eps 103-111)","6: \"Hohoemi no Bakudan\" by Matsuko Mawatari (eps 112)"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/pierrot.jp\/archives\/tv_list_1990\/tv_027.html"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=312"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=311"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/YuYu_Hakusho"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E5%B9%BD%E2%98%86%E9%81%8A%E2%98%86%E7%99%BD%E6%9B%B8_%28%E3%83%86%E3%83%AC%E3%83%93%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1%29"},{"name":"Syoboi","url":"https:\/\/cal.syoboi.jp\/tid\/1696"},{"name":"Bangumi","url":"https:\/\/bgm.tv\/subject\/8803"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-274739"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/www.funimation.com\/shows\/yu-yu-hakusho"},{"name":"Netflix","url":"https:\/\/www.netflix.com\/"},{"name":"Tubi TV","url":"https:\/\/tubitv.com\/series\/2272\/yu-yu-hakusho"}]}}
