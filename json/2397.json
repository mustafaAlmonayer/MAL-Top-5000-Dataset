It begins when a new Digimon Egg is found on the internet, and manages to penetrate into almost every computer system in Japan. When the egg hatches, it's identified as a new kind of Digimon, a Virus-type. It sustains itself by eating data from various system, and starts wreaking havok in Japan. As it consumes more and more data, it continues to evolve. And Taichi and Koushiro decide it's time to stop it.\n\nThey're off, sending Agumon and Tentomon through the internet to fight off this new enemy. But, with the Virus controlling systems like the American military, all too soon, this digital menace may become all too real. Calling in the help of Yamato and Takeru, they hope that they can stop what's already begun, and maybe save this world a second time.\n\n(Source: AniDB)","background":"Digimon Adventure: Bokura no War Game was aired in theaters as a double feature alongside the One Piece movie as part of Toei's Spring 2000 Anime fair. In the US release titled Digimon: The Movie, three of the Digimon films were edited together into one single film due to the low individual run time of them. It was released nationwide on October 6, 2000. Several heavy changes were made in this edit such as plot changes to make the story connected and a soundtrack featuring insert songs from artists such as Smash Mouth. Cumulatively, over 40 minutes was cut from the original releases. The movie was divided into three parts, which are respective of the original films.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/467\/Discotek_Media"},{"mal_id":841,"type":"anime","name":"Saban Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/841\/Saban_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids"}],"relations":[{"relation":"Prequel","entry":[{"mal_id":552,"type":"anime","name":"Digimon Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/552\/Digimon_Adventure"}]},{"relation":"Sequel","entry":[{"mal_id":1313,"type":"anime","name":"Digimon Adventure 02","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1313\/Digimon_Adventure_02"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Butterfly\" by Wada Kouji"],"endings":["\"Sakuhin No. 2 \"Haru\" I Chouchou ~Bokura no War Game!~\" by AiM"]},"external":[{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1149"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=2524"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Digimon_Adventure#Our_War_Game.21"}],"streaming":[]}}
