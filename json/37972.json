In desperate need of members, Toma Shinjou is looking to recruit capable players, but he fails to scout anyone. Enter Maki Katsuragi, a new transfer student who demonstrates great reflexes when he catches a stray cat in his classroom, instantly capturing Toma's attention. With his interest piqued, Toma ambitiously asks Maki to join the boys' team but is quickly rejected, as Maki doesn't wish to join any clubs. Toma refuses to back down and ends up persuading Maki\u2014only under the condition that Toma will pay him for his participation and cover other club expenses. \n\nAs Maki joins the team, his incredible form and quick learning allow him to immediately outshine the rest of the team. Although this gives rise to conflict among the boys, Maki challenges and pushes his fellow team members to not only keep up with his seemingly natural talent, but also drive them to devote themselves to the game they once neglected. \n\nThis story focuses on the potential of the boys' soft tennis club and their discovery of their own capability, while also enduring personal hardships and dealing with the darker side of growing up in middle school.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2019,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"01:58","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 01:58 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":145,"type":"anime","name":"TBS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/145\/TBS"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/166\/Movic"},{"mal_id":306,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Capsule","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/306\/Magic_Capsule"},{"mal_id":464,"type":"anime","name":"flying DOG","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/464\/flying_DOG"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":441,"type":"anime","name":"8bit","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/441\/8bit"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/30\/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[],"theme":{"openings":["\"Suisou (\u6c34\u69fd)\" by Megumi Nakajima"],"endings":["\"Kago no Naka no Bokura wa (\u7c60\u306e\u4e2d\u306e\u50d5\u3089\u306f)\" by AIKI from bless4"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.tbs.co.jp\/anime\/hoshiai\/"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=14200"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=21283"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hoshiai_no_Sora"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-282792"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/www.funimation.com\/shows\/stars-align"}]}}
