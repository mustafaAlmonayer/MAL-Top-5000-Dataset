Due to time constraints, certain footage in earlier episodes were cut during its broadcast and later restored on the Japanese home video releases, referred to as the Director's Cut. The North American Bandai Entertainment releases used the TV masters, so their English dub does not sync properly with the Japanese home video masters on those specific episodes. FUNimation later licensed the series and, in 2016, launched a successful Kickstarter to redub the entirety of the Director's Cut edition.","season":"spring","year":1996,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/23\/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"},{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/233\/Bandai_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/14\/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Isekai","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/62\/Isekai"},{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Love Polygon","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/64\/Love_Polygon"},{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/40\/Psychological"}],"demographics":[],"relations":[{"relation":"Adaptation","entry":[{"mal_id":565,"type":"manga","name":"Tenkuu no Escaflowne","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/565\/Tenkuu_no_Escaflowne"},{"mal_id":1857,"type":"manga","name":"Hitomi: The Vision of Escaflowne","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1857\/Hitomi__The_Vision_of_Escaflowne"},{"mal_id":9812,"type":"manga","name":"Escaflowne: Ishi no Kioku","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/9812\/Escaflowne__Ishi_no_Kioku"},{"mal_id":36299,"type":"manga","name":"Escaflowne","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/36299\/Escaflowne"}]},{"relation":"Alternative version","entry":[{"mal_id":393,"type":"anime","name":"Escaflowne","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/393\/Escaflowne"}]},{"relation":"Summary","entry":[{"mal_id":39329,"type":"anime","name":"Tenkuu no Escaflowne Recaps","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/39329\/Tenkuu_no_Escaflowne_Recaps"}]}],"theme":{"openings":["\"Yakusoku wa Iranai (\u7d04\u675f\u306f\u3044\u3089\u306a\u3044 - No Need for Promises)\" by Maaya Sakamoto"],"endings":["\"Mystic Eyes\" by Hiroki Wada"]},"external":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.sunrise-anime.jp\/sunrise-inc\/works\/detail.php?cid=118"},{"name":"AniDB","url":"https:\/\/anidb.net\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=184"},{"name":"ANN","url":"https:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=240"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Vision_of_Escaflowne"}],"streaming":[{"name":"Crunchyroll","url":"http:\/\/www.crunchyroll.com\/series-275603"},{"name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/www.funimation.com\/shows\/the-vision-of-escaflowne"},{"name":"Netflix","url":"https:\/\/www.netflix.com\/"}]}}
